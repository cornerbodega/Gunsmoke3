THE COURT: Good morning. Be seated.
MR. MARTINEZ: Good morning, Your Honor.
THE COURT: We are with the direct of Mr. Arce, right,
is going to continue?
MR. MARTINEZ: Yes, Your Honor. I have a procedural
question I would like to address with the Court at the
beginning.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. MARTINEZ: With respect to the pro offer, Your
Honor, I have two questions --
THE COURT: Wait a minute. You're talking about an
offer of proof that you intend to make sometime in the future,
right?
MR. MARTINEZ: So one question was when you want me to
do it.
THE COURT: Right. Okay.
MR. MARTINEZ: And if you want me to do it in your
presence or just to the court reporter? I'd prefer to read it
at this time, but I don't know when you want it.
THE COURT: Well, you want to make it orally, right?
MR. MARTINEZ: Yes.
THE COURT: Let's do it right after lunch, how's that?
MR. MARTINEZ: That's fine, Your Honor. I just needed

DIRECT EXAMINATION (RESUMED)
BY MR. MARTINEZ:
Q. Good morning, Mr. Arce.
A. Good morning.
Q. I'm going to try and stick to one mic and not wander.
MR. MARTINEZ: Let me ask you, can you please bring up
Exhibit 541? I believe 541 has been admitted or is stipulated
to as an exhibit, Your Honor. These are the Huppenthal
findings. I was checking with counsel that she agreed it was
stipulated to.
MS. COOPER: There's just a housekeeping matter that
we would like to address, if it's all right with the Court.
MR. MARTINEZ: Can we deal --
THE COURT: I'm sorry, a what matter?
MS. COOPER: A housekeeping matter with respect to a
couple of exhibits. But we can address it later.
THE COURT: All right. Fine. Let's do it later.
MR. MARTINEZ: Okay. I just wanted to confirm on
541 --
MS. COOPER: Yes.
MR. MARTINEZ: -- it's an admitted exhibit.
