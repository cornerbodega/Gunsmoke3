2 MR. JOHN CHRISTOPHER DEPP, RECALLED
3 CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. WASS, CONTINUED
4 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Sherborne, were you able to take
5 instructions from Mr. Depp on the sixth and seventh witness
6 statements?
7 MR. SHERBORNE: Iwas, my Lord, yes.
8 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: And have you had a word with Ms. Wass about
9 whether you need to examine in chief about that before she
10 continues her cross-examination?
11 MR. SHERBORNE: To be honest, I have not, and that is partly
12 because, as a result of the earlier starts, there is a lot of
13 setting up to be done, but we are also waiting for Ms. Laws.
14 MR JUSTICE NICOL: Iam sorry that Ms. Laws is not here, but we
15 are going to continue.
16 MR. SHERBORNE: Iunderstand that, my Lord. Iam trying to
17 explain why there is a certain amount of time taken up trying
18 to work out where she is because it is very uncharacteristic
19 that she is not here. 1 have not had an opportunity to do so.
20 My present understanding is that I am not going to be asking
21 any further questions.
22 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Right, there we are.
23 MR. SHERBORNE: If can leave it on that basis, my Lord?
24 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Good. All right. Ms. Wass, I said yesterday
25 that I would be minded to take a break in the middle of the

2 morning.
3 MS. WASS: Yes.
4 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: I appreciate that Mr. Depp has been giving
5 evidence and will have been giving evidence for some time.
6 MS. WASS: Yes.
7 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: When the morning is going to be three hours,
8 Tthink it is only fair to him that we take a break, but the
9 timing of the break I will leave to you.
10 MS. WASS: Thank you very much.
11 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Whenever is convenient in your
12 cross-examination.
13 MS. WASS: Thank you very much.
14 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: But if you can plan at about 11.30, roughly
15 speaking.
16 MS. WASS: Thank you very much, yes.
17 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Good. Yes,
18 MS. WASS: Mr. Depp, I am going to ask you now about some events
19 in March 2013, all right?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q Butbefore Ido, can you just answer this question yes or no.
22 Were you taking cocaine in March 2013?
23 A. Its very difficult to recollect if was taking cocaine in
24 March 2013. It is possible.
25 Q. You do not remember, but it is possible?
[Page 172]

--- Page 4 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 A. Ido not remember.
3 Q. Allright. The first time Ms. Heard met "the monster” was in
4 early 2013, when you and she were in her house together, and.
5 Tam going to ask you some questions about that.
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Do you accept that you spent some time in her house in Orange
8 Avenue, was it?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Before she moved into the Eastern Columbia Building?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. She lived there with her sister, Whitney?
13 A. There was a period, yes, where her sister lived there.
14 Q. And you and Whitney got on very well together?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. At that time?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And Whitney would really act as an intermediary between the
19 two of you if you had had an argument in this sort of period?
20 A. She has attempted to act as an intermediary, yes.
21 Q. Right.
22 A. A number of times.
23 Q. Allright. Ithink you felt so close to Whitney at that stage
24 that you saved her telephone number on your phone as "Sis"?
25 A. Yes.

2 Q. You called her Sis?
3A Yes
4 Q. She was not your sister, she was Ms. Heard's sister, but she
5 was family as far as you felt at the time?
6 A Yes
7 Q. Now, you in March of 2013, I suggest, were taking cocaine and
8 you had fallen off the wagon. You know what I mean by that.
9 Itis an expression that you used yesterday?
10 A. Indeed, yes.
11 Q. You were taking both drink and recreational drugs, in
12 particular cocaine, in March 2013?
13 A. Ifyousay that that is -—
14 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: That is a question, Mr. Depp.
15 A. Tamsormy. Again, Ido not remember if I was taking cocaine
16 MS. WASS: Allright. You have had a tattoo. I think you have a
17 number of tattoos, but I want to ask you about one particular
18 tattoo that you had put on one of your arms, I think, when you
19 were having a relationship with Winona Ryder.
20 A. Yes, ma'am.
21 Q. After you separated from Winona Ryder, you changed - the
22 tattoo read "Winona forever"?
23 A Yes
24 Q. And after you separated from Ms. Ryder, you took the last
25 syllable of her name and it was "Wino forever", and that is
[Page 174]

--- Page 6 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 how it read?
3A Yes
4 Q. That, presumably, was a joke when you did it at the time?
5 A ltseemed tobe.
6 Q. When did you have that tattoo shortened, the name shortened?
7 Was it years and years ago?
§ A. Yes many years.
9 Q. Tam not going to trouble you with the exact date. By March
10 2013, you had made an attempt at detox because we know about
11 your text between Elton John and Charlie Dunnit and 100 days
12 and all the rest of it?
13 A Yes
14 Q. Butby March 2013, you had fallen off the wagon. I appreciate
15 you say you do not remember?
16 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: think what Mr. Depp said was that he did not
17 remember if he was taking cocaine in March 2013. 1am not
18 sure if he answered specifically as to whether he had fallen
19 off the wagon.
20 MS.WASS: Allright. Do you remember whether you had fallen off
21 the wagon in March 2013?
22 A. Yes, Thad fallen off the wagon.
23 Q. You'had fallen off the wagon and how did that fall take place?
24 ‘What were you taking that was not part of your detox regime?
25 A. Ttook to drinking whisky.

2 Q. Allright, so it was just whisky or any other?
3 A And wine.
4 Q. And you are still not sure about the cocaine; yes?
5 A lam really not sure.
6 Q. And you were drinking on this occasion that Tam about to ask
7 you about. Miss -- let me just establish this. When you fall
8 off the wagon, as we have been calling it, do you feel very
9 disappointed with yourself?
10 A. Of course.
11 Q. And you do not really like to have your nose rubbed in it that
12 you have failed, do you?
13 A. (Pause) I suppose the image of having my nose rubbed in
14 something is, I would say, not a very nice way of dealing with
15 someone who, especially if you think that they have a drink
16 problem, rubbing their noses in it is, in my opinion, the
17 wrong way to go. That is what people have done with dogs for
18 years.
19 Q. Letus agree to this way of putting it, that you were
20 sensitive, having fallen off the wagon, and felt that it was
21 rather unkind to make a point of reminding you that you had
22 fallen off the wagon, or laughing at you because you had
23 fallen off the wagon?
24 A Well, it was most clear that I had fallen off the wagon with
25 regard to my relationship with Ms. Heard at the time, March
[Page 176]

--- Page 8 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 2013. Ibelieve that the day that you are referring to is
3 when we were at her apartment ——
4 Q. Shall Task you the questions rather than you anticipating
5 what they are going to be, but you are absolutely right.
6 A. Oh, good.
7 Q. It was when Ms. Heard laughed at the tattoo which read "Wino
8 forever" because at that stage, you, in effect, were acting
9 like a wino, like an alcoholic, and you felt very sensitive
10 about that. Do you agree?
11 A. Twould say that I initially was —- of course, very
12 disappointed in myself that after 160 something days, whatever
13 it was, that I had broken my sobriety.
14 Q. Tam asking you about Ms. Heard laughing at the tattoo in the
15 context of you having broken your sobriety?
16 A. Yes, maam, | am answering you.
17 Q. Mr. Depp, you were going over something that we have passed.
18 Tam sorry to have to keep you to the point, but as my Lord
19 said yesterday, I have a lot of ground to cover and it would
20 help the court if you answered the question specifically
21 rather than cover answers to previous questions. | understand
22 that can sometimes be difficult for somebody who is not used
23 to the court arrangements, but I am going to cut in if I think
24 ‘you are going off on a bit of a tangent. Thope you will
25 forgive me.

2 A Certainly. May I say one thing?
3 Q Could you answer the question, please?
4 A. Can you repeat the question?
5 Q. The question was, do you accept that Ms. Heard was making a
6 joke out of your tattoo "Wino forever"?
7 A. Ido not recall —
8 Q. Youdonot recall that?
9 A. -—any conversation or ——
10 Q And I suggest that that provoked disappointment, first of all,
11 in you and then anger in you, but you do not remember the
12 incident so you cannot say?
13 A. Ido not recall any argument about any of my tattoos.
14 Q. Iam going to put my case unless Mr. Sherborne objects. You
15 then, Mr. Depp, slapped Ms. Heard across the face. It was the
16 first time that you had ever used violence against her?
17 A Thatis not correct. That s untrue.
18 Q. As you can appreciate, | am putting what I suggest happened
19 and, as my Lord said yesterday, you have to say something, so
20 it is untrue, if that is your account, that is a perfect
21 answer to deal with that,
22 A. Itdid not happen.
23 Q. That is what you are saying. You slapped her more than once
24 because after you slapped her the first time, she did not
25 react. She eyeballed you, she just stared at you, and that
[Page 178]

--- Page 10 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 made you more angry and you slapped her again?
3 A. Thatis patently untrue.
4 Q. This happened in exactly the same way a third time. So, all
5 together, you slapped her three times on that occasion at her
[3 house in Orange Avenue?
7 A. lam sorry, but that is not true. You are mistaken.
8 Q. Tunderstand what you are saying. Very soon, you came to your
9 senses. It was an outburst of anger on your part and very
10 soon you came to your senses and you realised what you had
11 done and you broke down. You broke down and you started
12 crying and you started apologising and you told her you would
13 never hit her again?
14 A. Ididnot hit Ms. Heard
15 Q. Youexplained to her, I suggest, that this sudden loss of
16 temper was not you, but it was your sickness; is that how you
17 sometimes blame your behaviour on an illness, or a sickness?
18 A. No, ma'am.
19 Q. Youtold her, I suggest, for the first time, about the person
20 you had been calling "the monster”, your alterego, the person
21 who took over when you were under the influence of drink or
22 drugs?
23 A. No, ma'am.
24 Q. Now, Ms. Heard explained to you at some stage during the
25 relationship that she knew all about addiction, because her

2 father and, indeed. also her mother had been drug abusers?
3 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Justa minute. Do you agree that is what she
1 said to you?
5 THE WITNESS: Ido, yes, Ms. Heard did say to me that her father
[3 had —
7 MS. WASS: Yes, you became quite close to her father; you were in
8 touch with him over various critical points of your
9 relationship with Ms. Heard, were you not?

10 A. Twas very close with her father and very close with her

11 mother.

12 Q. Youknew that David Heard had had a problem with drug

13 addiction; you discussed it with him?

14 A Yes

15 Q. Ms. Heard explained to you, not in the presence of her father,

16 that she had seen her father try to get clean and she knew how

17 difficult it could be, and she felt (she, Ms. Heard) could

18 help you; that is what she said to you, was it not, that she

19 could help you with your multiple addiction problems?

20 A. Ido not recall that she said she could help me.

21 Q. Youactually did want somebody to give you support, did you

22 not, with your sobriety problems, or lack of sobriety

23 problems?

24 A. Thad some very good friends who had been through, who had

25 been sober for many, many years, so I sought counsel from

[Page 180]

--- Page 12 ---
1 DEPP - WASS

2 friends who had been through the same thing that I had been

3 through, similar things.

4 Q. In your witness statement -- and, my Lord, it is paragraph

5 18(d) -- I will read it out to you, unless you want to check

6 Tam reading it out correctly, but I am sure Mr. Sherborne

7 will correct me if I am wrong.

8 A. Thank you.

9 Q. What you said was this: "I was in recovery from drug
10 addiction during significant parts of my marriage to Amber.
11 Instead of supporting my sobriety, she often encouraged me to
12 drink alcohol and take drugs, even though she knew my
13 relationship with alcohol and drugs was a difficult one."
12 “Then you go on, at paragraph 23: "She never supported me in
15 my attempts to be strong, and to avoid alcohol and drugs." Do
16 you maintain those two statements are true? Do you want me to
17 take them one at a time?
18 A. I'would say that at that time Ms. Heard was not, there was no
19 ‘mention of me having a problem with drink, as the whisky that
20 I was drinking in Ms. Heard's apartment was in her freezer—
21 Q. Justasecond, | am going to stop you ----

2 Q. In your statement you are not talking about March, so I have
3 moved on from March 2013 -——
4 A Where are we now?
5 Q. toa general statement you made, which was: "I was in
6 recovery from drug addiction during significant parts of my
7 ‘marriage to Amber.” So, | am presuming you are talking about
8 your whole relationship with Amber.
9 A Allright, then yes.
10 Q Amlright? These are your words in your statement. You
11 said: "I was in recovery from drug addiction during
12 significant part of my marriage to Amber.”
13 A Yes, maam.
14 Q Thatis what you said?
15 A Yes.
16 Q And thatis true?
17 A. That is true, yes.
18 Q. Then, where I want your help: "Instead of supporting my
19 sobriety, she often encouraged me to drink alcohol and take
20 drugs, even though she knew my relationship with alcohol and
21 drugs was a difficult one for me." Do you maintain that was
22 true?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. So, you are saying she was actually encouraging you to fall
25 off the wagon at times?
[Page 182]

--- Page 14 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 A. Iwould say her actions were not of one who was supporting.
3 Q. Allright. Tunderstand that. Because you go on to say:
4 "She never supported me in my attempt to be strong and to
5 avoid alcohol and drugs."
6 A Yes.
7 Q. Is that true?
8 A lis
9 Q Itisnot true, is it? "She never supported me”, I am just
10 reading the words so you can consider the answer, "She never
11 supported me",
12 A. Ultimately the answer I would say is no, she did not.
13 Q. She never supported you?
14 A. Iwould say ultimately she did not.
15 Q. Isuggest that is not true. Afier this first time when you
16 hit her and apologised and promised it would never happen
17 again, she understood the problem of your drug-taking and
18 having a background that she did have of a drug-taking father,
19 she was very much offering her help and support to you?
20 A. Twould say if that was supportive, it was a strange way to
21 support me.
22 Q. You would go round and take cocaine at her house, would you
23 not? Sorry, I should have been specific -- at Orange Avenue.
24 A. Quite likely, on occasion.
25 Q. Can we be quite clear, Ms. Heard had told you that when she

2 was 18, she was regularly taking cocaine. Do you remember
3 that; do you agree with that?
4 A. Twould agree with that, she told me she was 16.
5 Q. We need not dwell on whether it is 16 or 18.
6 A. lam terribly sorry, you asked me the question.
7 Q. She was worried about the cocaine habit that she had developed
8 and she stopped altogether?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And she never took cocaine ever in your presence or your
11 company or, as far as you knew, during the time of your
12 relationship?
13 A. Yes,shedid
14 MS. WASS: You think she did.
15 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Justa moment. (Pause) Ms. Heard did take
16 cocaine in your presence?
17 THE WITNESS: She said -- she asked if Ms. Heard had ever touched
18 cocaine, something to that effect,
19 MS. WASS: Maybe I should be more careful
20 A. No, no. Iwould like to say that she did. Because there were
21 many times in our relationship carly on where not only did she
22 chop the cocaine with the razor blade into lines, she would
23 then take the cocaine on her finger and rub it on her gums.
24 Q. Tsuggest that she never took cocaine after she stopped taking
25 it as a teenager, but we have to disagree about that?
[Page 184]

--- Page 16 ---

2 A. My eyes have seen the action.
3 Q. Allright. Now, there was an occasion, if you can take the
4 text bundle at page 7. The text bundle is the first half of
5 bundle 6. Tt is page 7 of the text bundle.
6 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I think it is tab 119, is it not?
7 MS. WASS: That is exactly right.
8 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: What page are you saying, please?
9 MS. WASS: It is page 7. Does my Lord have it?
10 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I do.
11 MS. WASS: The second box down, Mr. Depp, there is a text from you
12 to, amongst other names, "Sis", do you see that on the
13 right-hand side?
14 THE WITNESS: Iam sorry, May 6th?
15 Q. Do you see where it says "Participants" at the top box?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. The text I am asking you about, the second line down, says
18 "Sis", and that is Whitney, is it not?
19 A. Yes, itis.
20 Q. You had sent this text to Whitney on 9th March, and it says
21 this: "We had a slightly grim morning...(reads to the
22 words)... just worried about her.” Do you agree you sent that
23 text to Whitney and you were referring to Ms. Heard in the
24 text?
25 A. Yes.

2 Q. On 12th March, if we can go to -- could we go to page — would
3 my Lord give me a moment, because there are references -- I am
a going ask you to go to page 20 of the text schedule and I am
5 going to explain something to the court, There is a series of
[3 four texts which are in the wrong chronological order. They
7 an be found in another document, but rather than go to other
8 documents I am going to deal with it in this way, because
9 I think you are familiar with this text exchange.
10 (To the witness) On 12th March, so if you go to the
1 do you have page 20 at the bottom, Mr. Depp?
12 A. Yes, page 20.
13 Q. If you go five up.
14 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Five up from the bottom?
15 MS. WASS: From the bottom.
16 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: So, the one that says "Working mate"?
17 THE WITNESS: Yes.
18 MS. WASS: No, sorry. Well, I forget whether itis five or four,
19 butitis one below that.
20 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: “Just thought you should know"?
21 MS. WASS: Yes, exactly.
22 THE WITNESS: Yes.
23 MS. WASS: Do you sec on the right-hand side, it says,
24 3.122013"
25 A. Yes, ma'am.

2 Q Infact, that is a text exchange which took place on
3 12th March 2013, you know what the text is about, the "Disco
4 bloodbath” text?
5 A. lam familiar with the Disco bloodbath text
6 Q Itisina place because the day and the month has been put
7 the wrong way, it should be earlier in the bundle. If you
8 need to see it in another format, I can show you.
9 A. Thisis fine, thank you
10 Q. Yousenta text to Ms. Heard: "Just thought you should know
11 there exists a book titled "Disco bloodbath", that is all.
12 She said: "We need that book." She then said: "Is it about
13 last Friday night, by any chance?" You said: "How can you
14 make me smile about such a hideous moment. Yes, itis. Funny
15 biteh, I fucking love you, you cunt.” Those are texts sent
16 between you and Ms. Heard on 3rd March. Do you agree with
17 that?
18 A Yes Ido.
19 Q. Allright. Can ask you to look at bundle 6.
20 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Sorry, you said 3rd March.
21 MS. WASS: Sorry, 12th March. It is a problem that seems to cause
22 difficulties with this text, because the 3 and the 12 has been
23 put in a different order.
24 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: It would be the American way.
25 MS. WASS: Exactly. But the text exists as an exhibit to

2 Ms. Heard statement, so we see the screenshot, but Mr. Depp
3 is not challenging, I do not think, that those texts were
4 exchanged with Ms. Heard on 12th March.
5 THE WITNESS: Iam not challenging it.
6 MS. WASS: All right. Unless my Lord wants me to -—
7 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: No, that is fine.
8 MS. WASS: (To the witness) You should have tab 6 because the
9 texts are there. Could you go to 148F, please. Itis in

11 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I think mine finishes at 148E. So, would this
12 be then in file —
13 MS. WASS: File 7. Mr. Depp. do you have it there?
14 THE WITNESS: Ido.
15 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Justa moment. (Pause) What is the
16 page number you want to refer to, please?
17 MS. WASS: F894.261.
18 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Iam afraid something has happened to my
19 bundles. I do not have that.
20 MS. WASS: Ican see Ms. Wilson has found another copy. Thank you
21 very much. Tam very grateful. (Pause) (Same handed)
22 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Do you have the page that Ms. Wass is talking
23 about?
24 THE WITNESS: Yes, I do, your Lordship.
25 MS. WASS: Do you recognise that kitchen top, or not?

2 A. Idonot recognise this kitchen top.
3 Q. If I'were to suggest to you that was a photograph taken on
4 8th March 2013 of your cocaine, lines of your cocaine, what
5 would you say?
6 A. Twould wonder if it were mine. Iwould wonder why itis
7 photographed.
8 Q. So, are you saying you cannot help us as to whether you
9 recognise it or not? My question was, do you recognise the
10 area where this was taken?
11 A. Irecognise that those appear to be lines of cocaine. Isee a
12 straw, a little bindle and I see clearly my credit card.
13 Q Yes. So, it looks as if the credit cards may have had
14 something to do with putting the lines of cocaine in that
15 formation?
16 A. Yes, it does.
17 Q. Do you recognise the work surface or tabletop?
18 A. Tamsorry, Ido not recognise it.
19 Q. Then, I presume you cannot say the date in that case, you are
20 not able to say whether you agree or not, whether it was
21 8th March?
22 A. Tam not even able to say if that is cocaine or not
23 Q. We will have to draw our inferences from that in due course
24 A. Yes, ma'am.

2 sister Whitney in Orange Avenue in California was hung a
3 painting by Ms. Heard's ex-partner, Tasya van Ree.
4 A. Yes, that is correct.
5 Q You remember yesterday we looked at Tasya van Ree and the
6 arrest in Seattle and Ms. van Rees exoneration of Ms. Heard;
7 do you remember that?
8 A. Ido remember talk of Ms. van Ree yesterday.
9 Q. And Ms. van Ree was an artist, and had a painting that
10 Ms. Heard kept in her bedroom, hanging on the wall; yes?
1A Yes
12 Q. Ithad been there from the very first time you had visited
13 Orange Avenue, do you agree; it is not something she put up
14 halfway through your visit, it has always been there?
15 A. Yes, it was there.
16 Q. There was an occasion in March 2013 when you visited Ms. Heard
17 at Orange Avenue, Whitney was not at home at the time but it
18 was an occasion when you arrived, drunk, and having consumed a
19 cocktail of cocaine and cannabis. Do you remember an occasion
20 when you arrived at Ms. Heard's house in that condition?
21 A. Not offhand, no.
22 Q. Do you accept that you are a compulsive smoker of cigarettes?
23 A. Yes, malam. I have a horrible addiction to nicotine, yes.
24 MR. JUSTICENICOL: Justa moment. (Pause) Yes.
25 MS.WASS: You also had a horrible addiction to cocaine in March

2 2013, 1 would suggest?
3 THE WITNESS: I have never had an addiction to cocaine.
4 Q. Did you have a little box, a special cocaine box, where you
5 kept your cocaine?
6 A. Aspecial box for my cocaine? No, not necessarily.
7 Q. Two inches square?
8 A. Thad asmall square box with a turquoise, it was a piece of
9 turquoise at the top and that was used to carry extra meds in
10 my pocket for when I was away, out about working
11 Q. Soyouare describing a pill box?
12 A. Itis a pill box, yes.
13 Q. lam talking about a little antique —
14 MR JUSTICE NICOL: Just I want to clarify. When you talk about
15 ‘your meds, you are talking about your prescription
16 medications?
17 THE WITNESS: Yes, exactly, prescription medications in there.
18 MS. WASS: Tunderstand. Iam not talking about that. Tam
19 talking about a cocaine box, not prescription drugs. This was
20 a square box with a skull and crossbows on it, "Property of
21 ID", it had something like that on it; do you remember?
22 A. Ido not remember that particular description of that box. It
23 is entirely possible, but I did not have any designated box
24 for illegal substances

3 ‘your memory has been impaired?
4 A No,maam
5 Q. You feel you have absolute clarity of recollection, do you?
6 A Yes.maum
7 Q. And you cannot remember this box?
8 A. Ihave received alot of gifs from people in my travels,
9 ‘people who appreciate, have appreciated what I have done in my
10 work and they have given me presents. So, there are boxes,
1 bracelets itis very difficult
12 Q. Again, Ihave the picture, you have lots of gifts.
13 A. Youcan interrupt me any time you like.
14 Q. donot want to doit if its relevant to the case.
15 Mr. Sherborne is looking after your interests admirably. but
16 Ido want to try and make some progress. All right?
17 A. Twas just tying to describe.
18 Q. Iunderstand what you are trying to describe.
19 A. Somy, lam temibly sorry.
20 Q. Now, I suggest that throughout your relationship with
21 Ms. Heard you were irrationally jealous of Ms. Heard and
22 regularly accused her of having affairs with other people?
23 MR.JUSTICENICOL: Justa minute. (Pause) What is your answer?
24 THE WITNESS: There were times when I suspected that Ms. Heard was
25 being untruthful with me, and there seemed to be, at the time,
[Page 192]

--- Page 24 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 good reason for me to have a care about what her actions were.
3 MS.WASS: We read out in court yesterday Ellen Barkin's
14 deposition, do you remember, and she described you as jealous?
5 A. Yes, shedid
6 Q. Would you describe yourself as jealous?
7 A. Yes, I can be jealous.
8 Q. And on the night in March 2013 that I am asking you about, you
9 were very jealous and accusatory of Ms. Heard, suggesting she
10 may be having or continuing her affair with Tasya van Ree, it
11 became an obsession of yours that night. Do you remember
12 that?
13 A. Iremember we had several arguments about Ms. van Ree. Iwill
14 not elaborate. Twill let you,
15 Q. Allright. Do you remember an incident where you had an
16 argument about Ms. van Ree and reference was made to the
17 painting that is hanging up in Ms. Heard's bedroom?
18 A. Yes, I remember.
19 Q. lam going to remind you what you said about it, and I am
20 going to suggest that something quite different happened.
21 What you said was that you, at some point around this time, so
22 this is March — I am reading from your statement, just so
23 that you know now.
24 A. Yes.

2 a painting she had recived from her former wife from the
3 bedroom, as a courtesy to me. I certainly did not hit
4 Ms. Heard." All right? So, you say there was an incident
5 when the painting was the subject of discussion?
6 A Yes, maam.
7 Q. In around March 2013?
8 A Iwill take your word on the date.
9 Q. This is what you referred to in your statement, I am -——
10 A. Isaid March, okay.
11 Q What you say in your statement is, you certainly did not hit
12 Ms. Heard on that date. All right?
13 A No,Ididnot
14 Q. When you asked her to remove the painting, according to your
15 recollection, what did she say?
16 A Ultimately, no
17 Q. No. She was not going to do what you told her, or asked her,
18 to do. Did you take no for an answer?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. You tried to remove the painting yourself, did you not?
21 A. No, I did not.
22 Q. Youtried to remove the painting, and Ms. Heard intervened,
23 and you slapped her?
24 A. That is not true.
25 Q. Youtook out your cigarette lighter, you had been smoking all

1 DEPP - WASS
2 the way through the evening, 1 suggest, in the kitchen of that
3 house: do you accept that you smoked in Orange Avenue,
4 indoors?
SA Yes. Ido.
6 Q. You had your cigarette lighter with you and you tried to set
7 fire to the painting?
8 A. That is not true.
9 Q And you were very physical with Ms. Heard, pushing her about
10 and grabbing her by the arm?
11 A Thatis also untrue.
12 Q. Ifyou go behind, are you at divider 67
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Go behind (unclear) there is a photograph, exhibit A, 148A.
15 Sorry, 148 not 148A, my fault.
16 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I think itis divider 148A. It is actually
17 divider 148A.
18 MS. WASS: Thatis not what I am asking about. Ms. Hamer has
19 reminded me, I want the very first photograph on 148, it
20 should be Ms. Heard taking a photograph in a mirror, with a
21 visible bruise on her arm.
22 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Iam going to ask somebody to assist me with
23 finding the picture,

2 I have understood what the question is about. (Pause) So,
3 this is now page?
4 MS. WASS: Sorry, F894.001. Do you remember, Mr. Depp, causing
B any injury to Ms. Heard’ arm?
6 THE WITNESS: No, ma'am, I do not.
7 Q. I'suggest when you said you had clear memories of events with
8 Ms. Heard, that quite the opposite is in fact true. You would
9 regularly behave in a way, you forgot how you behaved and
10 Ms. Heard started keeping records so that she could show you
11 what you had done. Do you agree with that?
12 A. Icannot make any statement as to Ms. Heard's motivations for
13 her photography of her various —
14 Q. Shemade it plain, I suggest to you, that because you had no
15 recollection of certain rather important events, as far as she
16 was concerned, when she was the subject of violence from you,
17 she started keeping records in the form of photographs, and
18 would remind you of these afterwards. What do you say about
19 that?
20 A. I'would say that I have never seen this photograph, so she did
21 not use it to remind me then.
22 Q. But you accept it shows her with a bruise on her arm?
23 A. Idoaccept itis a photograph of Ms. Heard with a bruise on
24 her arm, yes.
25 Q. This fight over the painting escalated, and at one stage you
[Page 196]

--- Page 28 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 hit her in the face with the back of your hand. So the first
3 slap was with the open part of your hand. You know what
4 mean by the back of your hand?
5 A. Yes, I see, yes.
6 Q. Hold your hand up now. You have some fairly serious rings on
7 your hand. You always wear those rings, do you not?
8 A. Yes, most of the time.
9 Q. There is no reason why you should not, but it means that if
10 you do hit someone with the back of your hand, it is likely to
11 cause more injury than somebody who does not have rings on, do
12 you agree?
13 A. Iwould say, yes, absolutely.
14 Q. Isuggest that you hit her with the back of your hand and that
15 was very, very painful to Ms. Heard, and that was quite
16 obvious to you, that you had caused her considerable pain?
17 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Do you agree with that, Mr. Depp?
18 A. 1did not hit Ms. Heard, and furthermore I have never hit
19 Ms. Heard.
20 MS. WASS: The day after the night of the painting, you were due
21 to appear on a film set. I think the film set was at
22 Sweetzer, your house at Sweetzer, because you were filming a
23 documentary about Keith Richards?
24 A. Yes, ma'am, that is true.
25 Q. AsIthink you said to us yesterday, he was an idol of yours?

3 Q. Ithink the documentary was made over a long period. It took
4 about four years all together, something like that?
5 A Yes maam. Itis sill not —
6 Q Itisstill not finished?
7 A No.
8 Q Right Anyway, in2015, there was a day when you were due —
9 Tam calling it on the film set, but it was actually at your
10 house. The filming was supposed to take place and everything
11 was set up for filming.
12 A Yes
13 Q. And Mr. Richards was there?
14 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Ms. Wass, did you say 20157
15 MS.WASS: My Lord is absolutely right. 2013, should have said
16 Do you agree with that?
17 A. Yes, Iwas doing a documentary on Keith —
18 Q. And there was a date in March 2013 when you were extremely
19 late on set?
20 A. Yes, thatis true.
21 Q. And suggest that was the date afer the argument with
22 Ms. Heard about the painting during which you hit her with the
23 back of your hand, so we can date this?
24 A. 1donot believe that that was the argument of that morning.
25 My recollection is that it is something very different.
[Page 198]

--- Page 30 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 Q. Another argument?
3 A. There was an argument, yes, another argument
4 Q Can summarise this in this way.
5 A Sure
6 Q Ms. Heard has itemised 14 episodes in her evidence in this
7 case when you used physical violence against her. You know
8 that, do you not?
9 A Yes. Ido.
10 Q. Itisalso clear from her statement that she says those were
11 not the only episodes. Those were the ones that she was able
12 to deseribe, but there were many more than that. That is also
13 her evidence, is it not?
14 A. Yes, itis.
15 Q. So,if you are saying incidents got mixed up, you are saying
16 there was another incident the night before the Keith Richards
17 filming; is that what you are saying?
18 A Yes maam.
19 Q. Tamnot going to ask you about another incident because
20 T want to go straight to what happened when you finally did
21 get to the film set. Whitney had not been at Orange Avenue
22 the night before the Keith Richards interview, the Keith
23 Richards filming, had she?
24 A. Idonot recall
25 Q. Youdo not recall that?

3 Q. Butshe retumed to the house the following morning?
4A Yes
5 Q. And she was presented with a complete mess to the kitchen.
6 There were lines of cocaine on the worktop and an almost empty
7 bottle of whisky. I think you said you were drinking whisky
8 at this time?
9 A Yes, maam,
10 Q. Youhad been smoking in the kitchen. There were cigarette
11 butts everywhere and there was broken glass on the floor and
12 the funiture was askew. That is the picture that Whitney was
13 presented with. Does that jog your memory at all?
14 A. Idonot recall the destruction that Whitney Heard is
15 describing. 1 remember the morning. I remember sitting at
16 the glass table, just outside her kitchen, and I was drinking
17 whisky.
18 Q. Whisky, in the morning?
19 A. Yes. Itwas quite a nasty moment, argument.
20 Q. And do you remember snorting cocaine?
21 A. 1do not remember snorting cocaine, no.
22 Q. Right. Could you look back in bundle 6?
23 A Yes
24 Q. Thisis the divider that my Lord now has your bundle 1, 4F.
25 We have looked at this, Mr. Depp, already, this tab.
[Page 200]

--- Page 32 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 A. Yes.
3 Q Could you tum over the photograph that we have already looked
4 at of your credit card with cocaine. You will have to turn
5 the file round because they are in landscape.
6 A. Yes, ma'am, I see that. Thank you.
7 Q. Sorry, I did not mean to patronise you.
8 A. No, no, no, otherwise I might not have done it, you never
9 know. Thank you, though.
10 Q. Firstofall, can we establish that that photograph is a
11 photograph of the glass table you have already described in
12 Ms. Heard's kitchen in Orange Avenue?
13 A. Yes.
14 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Now, 894F, 894.262; is that right?
15 MS. WASS: Yes, and 263. There are two photographs very similar.
16 You said you were drinking whisky.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Is that whisky we see in the glass on the right?
19 A. Yes, it looks like it
20 Q. I'mean, itis a highball-size glass, do you agree?
21 A. T'was wondering that because of the perspective of the photo.
22 Q. Lookat the top photograph of the two. It is probably better
23 from the perspective.
24 A. Thatis a highball glass. Iwas normally used to doing shots
25 of whisky, or sipping shots of whisky, but that is a highball

2 glass so perhaps it was whisky on ice.
3 Q. Whisky on ice: was it diluted with anything, do you remember?
4 A lee water. Thatisit.
5 Q. We can see the bottle. Can you see the bottle on the top
[3 photograph, just to the left of your logo-cd cup or whatever
7 itis? Do you see it just next to the newspaper, in front of
8 the newspaper?
9 A. Yes, mam, Ido. It looks like another glass to me.
10 Q Another glass?
11 A Thatis what it looks like to me.
12 Q. Ms. Heard does not drink spirits, does she? She drinks red
13 wine but not spirits?
14 A. Mostly, as I recall, yes, she drank red wine mostly, yes. |
15 do not believe she was drinking whisky.
16 Q. Lookat the bottom of that other receptacle for the whisky.
17 It has a very thick bottom. Can you see that? It is not like
18 a glass, it looks more like a bottle, do you agree?
19 A. Tknow the bottle of, the bottle was a, is a bottle, it was a
20 bottle of whisky called I am sorry, I am blanking on the
21 name. tis a bottle, liked the bottle at first because it
22 itis called Bulleit, Bulleit Bourbon, because it looks
23 like it comes from the twenties or thirties
24 Q. So does this look like a Bulleit bourbon bottle to you?
25 A. No, that is not, no.

2 Q. We will have to work out what that was at a later stage. Can
3 you see in the front that there is a little box, about two
1 inches by two inches, if we compare it to the size of the
B credit cards?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. "Property of JD", with skull and crossbones on it?
8 A. Yes, Ido.
9 Q That, I suggest, is your cocaine box. That is where you would
10 keep your cocaine, a special box you had?
11 A Idoremember the box.
12 Q. Do you remember it now?
13 A. Yes. 1did not remember the "Property of JD". Yes, that is a
14 box. It was carrying cocaine in it. would say I probably
15 was then.
16 Q. Ifyoulook at the bottom at the centre of the picture, there
17 are four lines of cocaine next to a credit card?
18 A Indeed
19 Q. Witha straw on top of the credit card.
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Ifthat is where you might normally carry cocaine, I think it
22 is safe to infer that that is what it was being used for on
23 this occasion: do you not agree?
24 A. Tdoagree. Iwas mistaken, I suppose. Iam terribly sorry.

2 A Temiblysorry.
3 Q Thisis why I was asking you about your memory, Mr. Depp, you
4 see, because I suggest that that box was very precious to you
5 at this time, for reasons that would be obvious, namely, that
[3 it contained the drug that you were very dependent on at this
7 time?
8 A. Iwas never dependent on cocaine. Itis very difficult to say
9 that someone is dependent on cocaine. It is not in the
10 category of opiates where there is a physical addiction and a
11 physical and painful withdrawal from that drug. Cocaine is
12 —
13 Q Canlstopyou?
14 A. Please stop me, yes.
15 Q You were not addicted to cocaine, and we can come to more
16 about your addiction when we look at your interaction with
17 Dr. Kipper; all right?
18 A Sue
19 Q. When Whitney arrived, as I have said, she was confronted with
20 alot of mess, but she was also confronted by whisky and lines
21 of cocaine on the kitchen table, which we can see in this
22 photograph, and not only that, she was also confronted by the
23 sight of Ms. Heard, who had obviously been crying; she was
24 very red and crying. Do you remember her crying when Whitney
25 arrived?
[Page 204]

--- Page 36 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 A. Iremember her crying a lot.
3 Q. Allright. That is the answer, thank you. You started
14 accusing Ms. Heard in front of her sister, Whitney, of
5 something to do with a friend called Marie de Villepin. Does
6 that name ring any bells to you?
7 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Just a minute. Marie?
8 MS. WASS: De V-I-L-L-E-P-I-N.
9 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Do you know that name, Mr. Depp?
10 A. Ido recall the name, your Lordship. I do recall the name
11 from when Ms. Heard went to France to make a film, I believe.
12 Q. Do you remember an argument about Marie de Villepin?
13 A. Ido, but I am not positive that that was at this time. Tam
14 sure it was not at this time. It was another argument.
15 Q. Another argument, all right. You, during the course of that
16 other argument, called Ms. de Villepin a slut?
17 A. Quite possibly, if | was angry and upset, but I do not agree
18 —
19 Q Allright, and we have looked at words that you have used to
20 describe women and I think you have said you are not proud of
21 them?
22 A. Well, when they are done in a joking manner with my ex-wife or
23 ‘my former partner, the mother of my children, in jest, it is
24 not representative of my feeling for women.
25 Q. When you called Ms. de Villepin a slut, it was not a joke,

2 I suggest?
3 A. Iflcalled her that name, then I am fairly sure that I meant
4 it.
5 Q. And when Whitney arrived, you accused Ms. Heard again of
[3 having an affair with Tasya van Ree and you tried to snatch
7 Ms. Heard's phone for texts. Do you remember doing that?
8 A Nomaam.
9 Q. And both Whitney and Ms. Heard remained with you for about
10 four hours, trying to persuade you to leave the house to go to
11 the film set, where you should have been.
12 A. Yes, that is true.
13 Q. And people were waiting for you, were they not, at the film
14 set?
15 A. Waiting for me? It was a day where it was not an interview
16 per se between Keith Richards and myself, which had already
17 been filmed. It was a day when Keith Richards and Tom Waits
18 were performing together in the studio, the live recording
19 studio, and I had made a call to my first assistant director,
20 my director of photography, and to the focus people, who were
21 all very dear friends and very talented. 1 told them I was
22 going to be held up for a while, but to go on without me
23 because essentially all they needed to do was capture. It was
24 just filming Keith and Tom --—

5 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Which —
6 MS.WASS: Tam just about to find out, sorry.
7 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Thatis all right. (Pause).
8 MS.WASS: Mr. Depp. if you put that to one side, we will come
9 back to the text in a minute. Itis bundle 7, tab S6C. At
10 the bottom, there should be the pagination H206 something, do
11 you see that?

13 MS.WASS: S6C, yes. Itis a series of texts.
14 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Depp, if your bundling is the same as
15 mine, the tab number for S6C is reversed so you may have to

2 A Somy.

3 Q Thatis from Mr. Deuters?

4 A Yes

5 Q Thattext?

6 A Yes maam.

7 Q. And he says, "We have started shooting, so you know", and then

8 you say, "Go, God damn it, 1am a fly on the wall, commence.

9 There is nothing I can add to whatever magic is already there.
10 Go, you make whatever calls (unclear) need to make them. 1am
11 on my way." Right?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q Ifwe look back, we can sce what this is about at 206.7.

14 “Keith is at the studio now, Keith is rehearsing." It looks,

15 does it not, as if this is to do with the rehearsals of Keith

16 Richards in the documentary?

17 A. In the studio, yes.

18 Q. Itlooks like itis to do with that, does it not?

19 A. Yes, Ibelieve Mr. Richards and Mr. Waits were going through

20 the material.

21 Q. You told us that Mr. Richards was a very important person in

22 your life. What was so important that was going on that you

23 would not leave the house to go and get to that meeting on

24 time, to that film set on time?

25 A. Atthat time, in our relationship, when things of that nature
[Page 208]

--- Page 40 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 would come up, especially an argument that was - especially
3 at that time — sorry, I have lost my train.
4 Q. Do not worry, I think the point is that you were late?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And we have agreed that there was an argument?
7A Yes
8 Q. You have agreed that Whitney came, you were waiting, they were
9 trying to get you away for four hours?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Ithink that answers the question unless there is
12 A. Yes, tome, it was more important to try to fix things, patch
13 things up with Ms. Heard at the time.
14 Q. Because your driver was called, was he not? Your driver was
15 called and Nathan Holmes was called to take you from
16 Ms. Heard's property at Orange Avenue to your house at
17 Sweetzer?
18 A. That would have been normal, yes.
19 Q. What suggest happened was that even when Mr. Holmes turned
20 up, you refused to leave the house. You were snorting more
21 and more lines of cocaine?
22 A. As the image comes in my head, and I see the cocaine on the
23 table and the whisky, as I said, I was mistaken, so | was
24 definitely partaking of the cocaine and the whisky that
25 morning. Yes, Nathan Holmes was called to retrieve me to take

2 me onwards to the set. The cocaine was, I believe there were
3 four lines laid out.
4 Q Thereare in the photograph, but I suggest you had had quite a
5 lot before then?
6 A. Well, four lines is not always for one person, let us say.
7 think — no, in fact, I know that Ms. Heard sister,
8 Whitney, was partaking of the cocaine as well
9 Q. This was cocaine that you were taking on your own. Miss Amber
10 Heard did not take any cocaine on that occasion. 1 suggest
11 there were occasions when she rubbed her gums with it, but
12 this was not one of them.
13 A. She would chop the cocaine up for me to make the lines.
14 Q. Are you suggesting that is what she did on this occasion?
15 A. Ms. Heard, ina lot of ways, is a creature of routine, and
16 there were certain things that she needed to do for me that
17 Twas not allowed to do for myself. So I am saying that she
18 was trying to sort of when I would arrive home, she would
19 take my boots off and that was a regular routine. So, it
20 ‘would not be anything out of the ordinary for her to chop
21 those lines out, and again, as I see it now, in my memory, I
22 recall Nathan was called, Whitney was there, and she
23 participated in the cocaine.
24 Q. So younow claim to remember this?
25 A. Well, you have opened my eyes.

2 Q. Yes, I understand, memory does that.
3 A Thank you for that.
4 Q. lam suggesting that you are not telling the truth about that,
5 Mr. Depp. that never, on any occasion, did Ms. Heard ever chop
[3 up lines of cocaine for you. She was extremely —
7 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: When you talk about Ms. Heard, you are talking
8 about Amber, are you?
9 MS. WASS: Yes, I called Whitney Henriquez, as she now is,
10 ‘Whitney, and Ms. Heard, Ms. Heard.
11 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Yes, I wanted to make sure that Mr. Depp.
12 understood the question. So the suggestion is, Mr. Depp, that
13 you are not telling the truth and Miss Amber Heard never took
14 cocaine. I think that was the question, was it not, Ms. Wass?
15 MS. WASS: Yes
16 MR. SHERBORNE: She never chopped lines —
17 MS. WASS: Never chopped lines.
18 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: And never chopped lines of cocaine preparing
19 them for you?
20 A. Iamafraid that you are incorrect.
21 MS. WASS: In fact, Ms. Heard was extremely disapproving of
22 cocaine, above all things, when it came to your repertoire of
23 controlled drugs.
24 A. She poured me the whisky and the cocaine was visible in front
25 of her. Twould, and T have experienced many times with

2 Ms. Heard that she would in fact chop the cocaine up for me so
3 that I could do the line, and then she would press her finger
4 into it and ingest it orally. So, I am not suggesting that
5 she did that in this case, but I am suggesting that it was a
6 normal duty that she felt obligated to do carly on
7 Q. Tsuggest there is no truth in that whatsoever.
8 A suggest that you are sadly mistaken
9 Q. Tunderstand, but we can go on and on and we both have made
10 —_—
11 A. Weare not going to go on and on.
12 Q. - our respectful positions clear. You would not leave the
13 house, Ms. Heard's house, unless Ms. Heard and her sister came
14 with you to the film set, would you?
15 A. No, that is not true.
16 Q. One of the conditions was that you would go in order to do
17 this filming of the documentary, but only if she went with
18 you, and she brought her sister in the car, and she brought
19 her dog, Pistol?
20 A. Inever said that I am not going there without them, without
21 Whitney or Ms. Heard, or Ms. Henriquez, or Mrs. Henrique.
22 Q. The position is, Mr. Depp, that you had consumed so much
23 alcohol and so much cocaine by the time you were due to go to
24 the film set that you were being utterly irrational and it may
25 well be that you simply do not remember what happened, but
[Page 212]

2 your behaviour that following moming, when Whitney arrived,
3 was very, very bad indeed?
4 A. My behaviour was bad in what way?
5 Q. lamabout to -—
6 A. lamsorry to ask the question.
7 Q. lamabout to tell you.
8 A Thank you.
9 Q. When you agreed to go, it was on the condition that Ms. Heard
10 went with you. She took her sister with her, and she took her
11 little teacup Yorkshire terrier, Pistol, with her. In the
12 car, as well as Whitney and Ms. Heard and Pistol, was your
13 driver. Was that Starling Jenkins?
14 A. Heis one of the drivers, yes.
15 Q. Do you remember which driver it was?
16 A. Ido not.
17 Q. No, and Nathan Holmes was there?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. Was Nathan Holmes somebody who had supplied drugs to you?
20 A. On occasion, Nathan would be able to safely get a hold of, you
21 know, get his hands on them, I suppose.
22 Q. Right. When you were in the car, you were smoking and you
23 opened the window and you were angry and you were aggressive?

3 A No,maam. Iwas notin that mode at all.
4 Q. And at one stage, you took hold of Ms. Heards dog. Itis a
5 tiny litle thing, is it not?
6 A. Verytiny.
7 Q. Youcan pick it up with one hand. One of your hands could
8 pick it up quite easily?
9 A. Ofcourse. It weighs about three pounds.
10 Q. Right. You took hold of Pistol and you held her out of the
11 window and started making howling noises?
12 A. lcansayitis a very enduring image, but itis absolute
13 utter falsity. Itis fraudulent. Its not true.
14 Q. Youthought this was a huge joke.
15 A. No, ma'am, I do not think hanging an animal, a small
16 defenceless dog that weighs three pounds, out of a window at
17 speed is -- that is not my idea of fun although my sense of
18 humour is slightly skewed,
19 Q. Iwas going to say, your sense of humour which you explained
20 Yesterday is perhaps rather niche; would you agree?
21 A. Itis niche, sure, I suppose that is a good way to put it.
22 Q. Were you laughing at a suggestion that you made that you could
23 put the dog in the microwave?
24 A. That suggestion of putting the dog in the microwave was not
25 something that I — well, put it this way. It was, that sort
[Page 214]

1 DEPP - WASS
2 of humour was a running joke between Ms. Heard, myself,
3 Mrs. Henriquez, her family, friends. Because they are so
4 ludicrously tiny, so I would not say that I was the inventor
5 of that particular joke, and also I was not the only one who.
[3 was -- I mean, I was not the only one who brought anything
7 like that up. It was normal
8 Q. Whilst you were behaving in this extremely bad way, as I have
9 set out.
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Nathan Holmes did nothing and Starling Jenkins did nothing.
12 A. Well, there was nothing for them to do, because there was
13 nothing like that happening.
14 Q. Do you remember Ellen Barkin's deposition yesterday, in which
15 she described throwing the bottle across the room towards her?
16 A. Ido remember that testimony.
17 Q. And she said the assistant did nothing. read it out to you
18 yesterday.
19 A. Yes, okay. I- the assistant did nothing
20 Q. You surround yourself with people who never try to control you
21 or tell you what to do, they just tolerate your bad behaviour
22 and their function is to clear up after you. What do you say
23 about that?

5 A Tamsony.
6 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Ms. Wass was asking you about the relations
7 you had with employees or other people who work with you.
8 THE WITNESS: Yes
9 Q What was being suggested was that you surround yourself with
10 people who never tell you what to do. Do you agree or
11 disagree with that?
12 A. Ivehemently disagree with it.
13 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Thank you.
14 MS. WASS: (To the witness) You lied to people about your alcohol
15 intake or falling off the wagon, if I can call it more
16 generally, did you not; you concealed that from people?
17 THE WITNESS: No. Ihave not concealed it in this case at al.
18 Q Youconcealed itat the time it was happening?
19 A. Ifone is doing cocaine, I do not think it is something that
20 one should spill out on a restaurant table or amongst other
21 people. It is something that one wants to keep in private,
22 yes.
23 Q. You had your sobriety friends, I think you called them, you
24 have said Mr. Dunit was one of them, Elton John was another

4 THE WITNESS: Yes, your Lordship. Thank you
5 MS. WASS: There is a text from Mr. Dunnit to you, dated
6 13th April 2013
7A Yes.
8 Q. So, within a week or two of these two incidents, where we saw
9 the cocaine lined up, and in the second photograph the quite
10 considerable amount of whisky on the kitchen table; agreed?
11 A. Onthe table, yes. There was whisky and cocaine.
12 Q. This text took place a couple of weeks after the whisky on the
13 table photographs we have looked at?
14 A Okay.
15 Q. Mr. Dunnit says: "Morning, Johnny, back home in the smoke.
16 Funeral went well, and unusual not a fight in sight. Hope
17 you're feeling better on day 487, that's a lot of days sober
18 oreven 15 months." I mean, this chap, Charlie Dunnit,
19 thought you had been sticking to the plan of sobriety, did he
20 not?
21 A. It appears so, yes.
22 Q. You did nothing to set the record straight and confess to what
23 you had been doing?
24 A. We do not see any of my responses to Mr. Dunnit here.
25 Q. Do you suggest that you said to him, "Charlie, I have to come

1 DEPP - WASS
2 clean, T have been snorting humongous amounts of cocaine in
3 the last month and drinking whisky"; are you suggesting you
4 sent a text like that?
5 A. Isuggesting and I am pretty sure, especially having been in
6 touch with Elton, and Charlie, that I would have told Elion
7 that I failed and that I had gone back, and I would have told
8 Mr. Dunnit at some point
9 Q. Youcan help us with the evidence of that, if you can find it;
10 is that what you are saying?
11 A. Lean certainly try and find that, but I believe it was more
12 than likely in person - with Elton, I mean.
13 Q. No documentary proof then?
14 A. Excuse me?
15 Q. No documentary proof?
16 A. Iwill check. Iwill try and find it.
17 Q. Allright. That would be very helpful
18 A. Absolutely.
19 Q. Canyou goto the next text down, which is actually a month
20 later, which would be in May. You send a couple of texts to
21 Mr. Deuters, your personal assistant.

14 Q. What was not a joke, I presume, was the fact that you wanted
15 some butterfly bandages for your injured hand?
16 A. That does not seem like a joke.
17 Q. That does not sound very funny. So, it would appear, would it
18 not, that when this text was sent, it appears to be in the
19 ‘morning, because you have said you had cut your hand last
20 night and it was quite a serious cut, do you agree, if it
21 required stitches or may require stitches?
22 A. Yes. Iam looking at that and I see, yes, it seems to have
23 happened. 1am just trying to remember what the cut was,
24 this,

[Page 220]

--- Page 52 ---

2 occasions when you were in drink or drugs and only realised
3 the extent of your injury the following morning? Because you
4 do not appear to have realised the seriousness of the injury
5 the previous night, do you, if you only asked for bandages the
6 following morning.
7 A. Well, if I had cut my hand I am sure | wrapped it in something
8 and then would deal with it the next day.
9 Q. Do you remember this incident at all?
10 A. 1do not remember it, no.
11 Q. Allright. Iwill move on. You have made it plain that
12 Ms. Heard was not supporting your sobriety, and I have
13 suggested that is not true. You had a friend called Paul
14 Bettany.
15 A. Yes, ma'am.
16 Q. And Paul Bettany and you both shared an enjoyment of
17 controlled drugs and/or alcohol; do you agree?
18 A. Attimes, yes, we did.
19 Q. Did you share with Paul Bettany the fact that Ms. Heard was
20 trying to wean you off drug taking?
21 A. Yes.
22 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Just a minute. The question was, did you
23 share with Mr. Bettany?
24 MS. WASS: The fact that Ms. Heard, Amber Heard, was trying to
25 wean Mr. Depp off drink and drugs. Mr. Depp agreed.

2 (To the witness) You did say that, that sort of thing,
3 Tam not asking for verbatim.
4 THE WITNESS: She was quite adamant that I not drink any more and
s she was quite adamant that I should stop any use of cocaine or
[3 recreational drugs, yes
7 Q. Thank you for that. But how does that last statement that she
8 was adamant you should not drink alcohol or take drugs,
9 recreational drugs, how does that square with your suggestion
10 that she did not support your sobriety, which is in your
11 statement?
12 A. Well -—
13 Q. Let me remind you what you said: "l was in recovery from drug
14 addiction during significant parts of my marriage to Amber.
15 Instead of supporting my sobriety, she often encouraged me to
16 drink alcohol and take drugs, even though she knew my
17 relationship with alcohol and drugs was a difficult one for
18 me. She never supported me in my attempt to be strong and to
19 avoid alcohol.” When I read that to you earlier you said you
20 stuck by that, she never supported you. Now you are saying to
21 Mr. Bettany that she was telling you to stop the drink and the
22 drugs.
23 A. Twould say, yes, the full support of someone who is believed
24 to be an alcoholic or someone who is believed to be addicted
25 to drugs, I would say would then themselves stop drinking in
[Page 222]

--- Page 54 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 front of that person and stop doing drugs around that person.
3 I would say that that is full support. That is support of
4 someone that you love and that you care about. If you ask
5 them to make the sacrifice, you should be willing to make the
6 sacrifice yourself, I believe.
7 Q Allright. Just for the avoidance of doubt, Ms. Heard would
8 drink two or three glasses of wine quite regularly in the
9 evening, would she not, even when you were trying to be sober?
10 A. Ibeg your pardon, but it was two or three bottles.
11 Q. Thatis a complete nonsense, Mr. Depp.
12 A. Ifthatis how you feel about it, I respect —
13 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Depp, I have said this to you before, but
14 itis Ms. Wass’ job to put her clients case.
15 THE WITNESS: Yes, Iam not disagreeing with that.

17 three glasses. But | am interested in your evidence, and if
18 your evidence is that she had two or three bottles, not just
19 glasses, then that is it what I will make a note of.
20 THE WITNESS: That is exactly what I said, your Honour. And she

17 all that is left to do is create a website with the domain
18 name, Johnny Depp shaves Amber Heard's beaver, and then we
19 sell advertising space like fucking crazy. Clearly there are
20 ‘many spin-offs, you could poke/punch.” Do you remember that
21 e-mail - sorry, that text?
22 A. No, Ido not remember this one in particular.
23 Q. Do you think that is a respectful way of somebody, here your
24 friend Paul Bettany, talking about your girlfriend?
25 A. Itis not the most respectful way to speak about Ms. Heard.

2 They had their differences and they were, did not like each
3 other very much.
4 Q. Letus go down. You send a text to Mr. Bettany on 11th June:
5 “Let's bur Amber.” Do you remember sending that?
6 A. Ido not remember sending it, but I remember the exchange.
7 Ihave read it, yes.
8 Q. Letus just carry on with the exchange, then.
9 A Yes please.
10 Q. On the 6th -- sorry, 11th June. Mr. Bettany then says:
11 "Having thought it through, I don't think we should bum
12 Amber, she is delightful company and casy on the eye, plus I'm
13 not sure she's a witch. We could of course try the English
14 course of action in these predicament, we do a drowning test
15 Thoughts? NB, Ihave a pool." You then say: "Let's drown
16 her before we burn her. 1 will fuck her burnt corpse
17 afterwards to make sure she's dead.” And Mr. Bettany says:
18 “My thoughts entirely, let's be certain before we pronounce
19 her a witch."
20 Now, this reference to her being a witch was, I suggest,
21 a reference to the fact that she was trying to stop you
22 drinking and taking drugs and that you resented her for doing
23 that and were joking with Mr. Bettany about her being a -- the
24 ‘moral police, that sort of thing?
25 A. Again, her — Iwill just answer the question. Sorry, what is

2 the question exactly?
3 Q. Isuggest these references to Amber being a witch, which came
a from Mr. Bettany.
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And certainly you joined in.
7A Yes
8 Q. Were references to the fact that she was trying to spoil your
9 fun, as you saw it, by being able to take drugs and drink as
10 much as you chose to. Do you agree with that or disagree?
11 A. Thad spoken to Mr. Bettany quite a lot, as we were working
12 together, and he was a very close friend, so he knew of our
13 arguments and fighting, and he knew details. 1 was resentful
14 of the fact that Ms. Heard was very aggressive and quite
15 insulting about my use of alcohol, or if cocaine came into the
16 picture, she did not like Mr. Bettany, and I am afraid she did
17 not really like me all that much either, and she was
18 constantly harping on things that did not even exist.
19 Q. She did not like you when you were high on drugs and drunk on
20 alcohol, did she?
21 A. She did not like that she — she did not like me using alcohol
22 or drugs, because she had some delusional idea tht they
23 tuned me into, as you have spoken about, this said monster.
24 Q. Allright. I think that is very helpful. Thank you for that
25 A. Youare welcome,

7 Mr. Depp gets to the page.

9 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Ithink it is actually 12, it may be difficult
10 to tell.
11 THE WITNESS: Thank you.
12 MS. WASS: Ithink we are all looking at the same document. Just
13 to remind ourselves, your text about burning Amber and fucking
14 her bumt corpse were on 11th June, when you were exchanging
15 these sentiments with Mr. Bettany. On the same day, to the
16 time very near, it would appear, Ms. Heard wrote this e-mail
17 to herself, but it is dated, you see, on 11th June.

2 which one I am dealing with until it's too late. The drinking
3 assures me that I'm dealing with the monster, the abused,
4 scared, insecure, violent ttle boy. 1just can't tell where
5 the line starts. Also, drugs seem to guarantee I will be
[3 forced to deal with the monster as well once again. Its
7 knowing what, how much and when which makes all the
8 difference. Sometimes the hangover the morning after is just
9 as bad as the full-on disco bloodbath I've come to expect.
10 Youlive in a world full of enablers, you cut out and resent,
11 whether you realise it or not, everyone who isn't an enabler.
12 I can make a clear distinction as to who falls into which
13 category with complete ease. Just how often you see them and
14 what role they play in your day-to-day life distinguishes
15 where they fall on the enabling scale. 1 watched yesterday as
16 everyone around you picked you up off the floor, held you up
17 and got on with your life, prevented you from really falling.
18 With so much help of course you can't know how much this hurts
19 you and your life, because you pay people around you to
20 prevent your feet from having to hit the rock bottom, as they
21 say. Yesterday I saw you pass out amongst vomiting three
22 times, all three times Jerry" — that is a reference to
23 Jerry Judge, your security?

4 have embarrassed yourself countless times if someone would be
5 honest enough to tell you, to show you. If someone filmed you
6 while you were in this state you would be mortified. Ifis
7 embarrassing just to watch it happen. You can't know because
8 people, friends, keep smiling at your face and then turning
9 their heads and rolling their eyes at how ridiculous they feel
10 and look picking up a grown man from his own piss and vomit,
11 knowing he'll never be able to realise how bad he is. Hung
12 over, post pills is not much better. You're mean and
13 insensitive. 1 have no reason I have to stay with you and I
14 won't. You don't pay. I don't have to lie to you for my job,
15 livelihood or kids. I will never want to be locked into you.
16 My freedom is now, I realise, the only thing I have to protect
17 me. Twill never ever trust you to trap me. I myself watched
18 you pass our cold on the floor after drinking yourself sick.
19 One of these times you cut yourself so badly you needed
20 stitches." Do you accept, Mr. Depp, that ties in with the
21 text where you are asking for stitches?
22 MR. SHERBORNE: My Lord, with respect, Ms. Wass is reading out an
23 «e-mail that was never sent, and she is using it no doubt as a

2 question of this actual document, as opposed to trying to put
3 references to somehow get this into evidence.
4 MS.WASS: Allright. Let me go further down the document, then,
s Mr. Depp, then Iwill ask a question. Can you see three lines
6 from the bottom, of that page, we have a sentence that says:
7 “And you get the convenient benefit of never having to
8 remember it. Thats nice for you, so you get away with so
9 ‘many lies that you tell yourself, you actually trick yourself
10 into thinking the craziest lies when you are fucked up.
1 Because you are so accustomed to people not calling you out on
12 your bullshit, they work for you, hello. You actually believe
13 Your shit. Need a reference about how you actually thought I
14 hit you first or that T was hiding drugs, the list goes on,
15 admit some of your own shit first."
16 MR.SHERBORNE: My Lord, all Ms. Wass is doing is literally
17 reading the entire document. She said she was going 10 ask a
18 question. We are still waiting for that question.
19 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Ms. Wass, I think you need to ask a question.
20 MS. WASS: Iwill ask the question now and then I will ask
21 something else. (To the witness) Your answer to Ms. Heard's
22 allegations that you were a serial domestic abuser i that
23 this is a hoax and she is playing a hoax to somehow get
24 attention or to associate herself with the #MeToo movement
25 “That is your answer to these allegations she makes, is it not?
[Page 230]

--- Page 62 ---

2 You never hit her, she hit you, and she is developing this
3 hoax.
4 THE WITNESS: "Hoax" is probably the best word one could use.
5 Because the allegations, all of the allegations, are patently
6 untrue.
7 Q. Yousee, in this e-mail, which, as I said, is dated, she
8 accuses you of having hurt her physically and emotionally.
9 A. Is this the e-mail she never sent?
10 Q. Thisis the e-mail she never sent. We know she wrote this,
11 you see.
12 A. Twish she had sent it.
13 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Depp, wait now for the next question,
14 please.
15 THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.
16 MS. WASS: Can you think of any reason why Ms. Heard would have
17 written a letter like this, which she did not send to you,
18 describing somebody who was regularly out of control to the
19 extent that they would pass out, vomited and soiled
20 themselves, somebody who would be protected by their staff,
21 somebody who had no recollection of what they had done once
22 they had sobered up? How does that document, can you think of
23 any reason why that would be sent in 2013 before you had even
24 asked Ms. Heard to marry you?
25 A. From hearing you read this text to me that was not sent to me;

2 Q E-mail.
3 A. E-mail excuse me -- and from some of the information that
4 I have gamered from this, my experience yesterday and having
5 studied the case, I will suggest, ma'am, that it appears to me
6 that Ms. Heard was building a dossier very early on that
7 appears to be an insurance policy for later
8 Q. So, can just understand this. Her hoax, as you have
9 described it.

10 A. Youdescribed it as a hoax, and I agree.

11 Q. Ithink itis in one of your documents, but I will find that

12 after the break.

13 A. Thank you very much

14 Q. The hoax was not just a question of her making a false

15 allegation in a domestic violence restraining order, this is

16 something she had plotted for three years

17 A. Four -- oh, no, three, you are correct.

18 Q. Three years. And that is your explanation for the e-mail

19 1 have just read to you?

20 A. By the evidence that I have seen —--

2 MR.JUSTICENICOL: Yes. Mr. Depp, we are going to take a break
3 now, to enable you to stretch your legs.
4 THE WITNESS: Thank you, sir.
5 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: We will resume in ten minutes’ time. You must
6 not talk to anybody about your evidence. The qualification
7 1 added last night has now come to an end. It is now an
8 ‘prohibition on talking to anybody about your evidence. Do you

10 THE WITNESS: I absolutely understand. Thank you, your Lordship.
11 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: We will take ten minutes.
12 (A short break)
13
14 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Yes, Ms. Wass?
15 MS. WASS: Mr. Depp, before we broke off, do you remember you said
16 "hoax" was my word and I said I would look up where I had seen
17 itin your documents. I have found a reference, if I helps.
18 1 can either show it to you in the document, if you are happy
19 for me to read it from your statement, and Mr. Sherborne will
20 interrupt if I have misquoted anything that you have said. At
21 ‘paragraph 19 of your second witness statement, you say this:
22 "The sad irony of her abuse hoaxes" you were referring to
23 Mr. Heard — "is that they mirror what she actually subjected
24 to me during the course of our relationship.” It is your

3 A Pardonme.
4 Q. Doyouaccept that?
5 A Yes Ido. Iam sory.
6 Q. You have made it plain from what you said before we broke for
7 our ten-minute break, slightly extended, that she must have
8 been planning, now you have looked at all the material, you
9 know she was planning that hoax for at least three years?
10 A. Yes,
11 Q. Okay. Iam going to move on to another subject. Your
12 birthday is on 9th June, and in 2013 a group of you went toa
13 place called Hicksville, Hicksville trailer park in
14 California.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. You remember that occasion?
17 A. Ido remember the occasion, I do not recall it was my
18 birthday.
19 Q. Itmay well not have been your birthday and it may be that the
20 date is difficult to ascertain, we are happy for any
21 information about this. But you agree that around the time of
22 your birthday, which is on June 9th, so before or after, late

6 A Yes
7 Q. You were all staying in the trailer park?
8 A Yes
9 Q. Agroup of you had taken over a number of these trailers?
10 A. Yes, Ibelieve they were all reserved.

18 A Yes
19 Q. Do you remember an occasion when you were in your apartment
20 and Kirstie Sexton was there and, there were doctors there,
21 because you needed to take a drugs test for insurance
22 purposes; do you remember an occasion like that?
23 A. Yes, taking drugs tests for films, when you are what they call

2 Q. Everything. All right. You told Kirsty Sexton not to worry,
3 because those tests were easy to fake?
4 A. Those tests are not easy to fake. Ido not recall saying
5 that.
6 Q. Have you ever faked a drugs test —
7 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Just a minute, please.
8 MS. WASS: Iwithdraw that last question. Iwill move on to
9 Hicksville. You say that never happened?
10 A. What never happened? Iam sorry.
11 Q. The interchange about you saying how easy it was to fake a
12 drugs test?
13 A. Ihave never faked a drugs test, no.
14 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Iunderstand that is part of your answer.
15 Have you any recollection of saying to Kirsty Sexton that you
16 had faked a drugs test?
17 A. No, your Lordship.
18 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Thank you.
19 MS. WASS: Now, do you agree that the visit to Hicksville was
20 around the time, and by around I mean within a month or so, of
21 the texting that we saw with Paul Bettany when you were going
22 to burn Amber?
23 A. Icould not be sure of that
24 Q. Right, because that, we know, was about 4th or 11th June and
25 within a few weeks either side. You cannot be sure of the
[Page 236]

--- Page 68 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 date at all? Tdo not want to press you if you cannot.
3 A. Thave just do not recall the date we were at Hicksville.
4 Q. Tunderstand. Do you accept that was a period when you were
5 ‘both drinking and taking controlled drugs, in particular
6 cocaine, or MDMA and/or mushrooms?
7 A. On the trip to Hicksville, there was, of course there was
8 alcohol. In general, everybody had their drug of choice so
9 there were some people doing MDMA, mushrooms. was drinking
10 ‘myself and I was smoking marijuana. I ingested three,
11 probably three little, as they call them, stems of the
12 ‘mushrooms, but to no effect.
13 Q. Ithink you had a quantity of white powder with you?
14 A. Twas not using cocaine at Hicksville.
15 Q. What about MDMA?
16 A. 1did not do any MDMA at Hicksville because it would have been
17 a waste of time. It does not do much to me.
18 Q. Well, you brought drugs to the party, to the Hicksville party,
19 did you not?
20 A. Tbrought marijuana and -- well, I brought marijuana.
21 Q. Again, we are going to have to agree to disagree. I suggest
22 ‘you brought a quantity of white powder. Whether that was
23 cocaine or not, that was something that you had. Do you
24 remember in the evening, the group of you were sitting around.

3A Yes
4 Q. Yes, and the drugs that were taken on that occasion, they were
5 recreational. Do you agree with what I am saying? It was a
6 sociable event?
7A Yes
8 Q. Itisnot uncommon, in the circles that you move in, that
9 people take recreational drugs, particularly in a party
10 setting?
11 A. Itis not uncommon, no.
12 Q. And that was the level of drug-taking there apart from your
13 drug-taking, Mr. Depp, because you took considerably more
14 drugs than anyone else that night?
15 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Well, Ms. Wass, if that is a question, then
16 Mr. Depp needs the opportunity to answer it.
17 MS. WASS: Yes, you took considerably more drugs than anyone else
18 that night, did you not?
19 A. No, ma'am.
20 Q. Youstarted to get angry, the monster joined the party, and
21 ‘you took exception to a woman who was in your group called
22 Kelly Sue. Do you remember Kelly Sue?

2 Q. Kelly Sue was sitting very close to Ms. Heard and was being
3 rather affectionate?
4 A. Rather affectionate,
5 Q. You took exception to this?
6 A. Yes, Idid. She was putting her hands on Amber and I thought
7 it was an uncomfortable position to put her in.
8 Q Toput Amber in, to put Ms. Heard in?
9 A. Toput Ms. Heard in, yes.
10 Q. Ms. Heard was not saying I mean, Ms. Heard is quite a
11 feisty woman, as you have said more than once in your
12 descriptions of her. She is more than capable of saying to
13 somebody, "Get off of me" if they touch her and she does not
14 want them to. Why did you have to take exception to Kelly
15 Sue?
16 A. Isuppose Ms. Heard did not have to
17 Q. So you were being the Southern gentleman again, were you, that
18 night?
19 A Ifyoulike.
20 Q. Because you actually became extremely angry with Kelly Sue,
21 and became quite unpleasant, shouting at her, and eventually
22 saying to her, "Do you know how much pressure it would take to
23 break your wrist?"
24 A. Itnever happened.

2 Miss Kelly Sue?
3 A Aslrecall the incident, it was not around the campfire where
4 Twas playing the guitar. It was at nightfall when we were
5 looking around the place and there was a pool table and there
[3 was a pool and you could climb the ladder to get to it. As
7 the girls were congregating, this Kelly Sue began to touch
8 Ms. Heard in ways that were beyond what one would accept as
9 normal affection. They were quite sexual and they were quite
10 aggressive and she was clearly very high.
11 Q. And your impression was that Ms. Heard did nothing to prevent
12 this show of an affection from Kelly Sues is that right?
13 A. Iremember that she just sort of was looking at her, smiling.
14 Ihelieve Miss Kelly Sue was a friend of Raquel Pennington's.
15 Q. It perhaps does not matter who she was a friend of?
16 A. Ithink it does just in terms of maybe she did not want to be
17 rude to Raquel friend.
18 Q. Isee, soit was not a question of Ms. Heard going along with
19 this show of affection; it was a question of her not feeling
20 able to rebuff it?
21 A. Ithought it was an uncomfortable situation for her.
22 Q. And how did you deal with that uncomfortable situation?
23 A. Iremoved Miss Kelly Sue's hand from Ms. Heard's body and
24 Itold her not to do that, that first of all, that is my girl;
25 second of al, itis rude and invasive. She was quite
[Page 240]

--- Page 72 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 glassy-eyed and she seemed pretty unsure of her surroundings.
3 She seemed very unstable on her feet and I remember saying to
1 ‘her, "If you are going to take this drug, MDMA, you should
5 know if you are able to handle it or not."
6 Q. Right?
7 A. "Do not take it if you cannot handle it."
8  Q. Yousee, | am going to suggest that you were quite angry by
9 Kelly Sue. It was not a polite removal of the hand. You were
10 quite forceful and you made the threat that I have already
11 suggested to you, which you have denied. But not only that,
12 you were actually quite angry with Ms. Heard about this.
13 A. No, ma'am.
14 Q. And you had a big argument with Ms. Heard when you got back to
15 ‘your trailer?
16 A. We did have a big argument when we arrived back at the
17 trailer, yes.
18 Q. The argument was really fuelled by two things: one was the
19 fact that you had consumed a lot of alcohol and drugs that
20 night, and you had become very aggressive, as we have seen in
21 that video that you are prone to become; and secondly, that
22 you were very jealous and, again, you have accepted that you
23 ‘have on occasions been jealous. That is why the argument
24 started. The argument started about Kelly Sue.
25 A. Inaway, it did, yes, you are correct. The argument did

3 because when we arrived back to our trailer, Ms. Heard began
4 to yell and scream at me that I had ruined everyone's weekend

3 Thad ruined everyone's good time. So I was demeaned for
7 being concerned.

9 A. Yes. Ithink when people are under the influence of MDMA and
10 mushrooms and alcohol at that level, you can get quite hyped
11 up, because in the MDMA, there is a lot of speed in the MDMA.
12 So, she was on a very good run, let us say, Ms. Heard. She
13 was quite pumped up.
14 Q. I'suggest that Ms. Heard took mushrooms that night — not
15 MDMA, but mushrooms. It is quite a different effect, is it
16 not?
17 A. Well, mushrooms is a different effect, Mushrooms are
18 hallucinatory.
19 Q. Hallucinogenic?
20 A. Itisa hallucinatory drug, psilocybin, so if she is on a
21 hallucinatory drug and I am not on a hallucinatory drug to the
22 degree that she is, then her recollection could be maybe a
23 little skewed.
24 Q. Well, you were on MDMA mixed —
25 A Twasnot.

1 DEPP - WASS
2 Q with speed?
3 A Twasnot
4 Q. And suggest you were very hyped up, very, very hyped up
5 indeed?
6 A. Twas not on MDMA. As I did not have MDMA, I believe that was
7 left up to Ms. Heard friends to bring that along. Again, if
8 they had MDMA, which they did, I would say there was not
9 enough to go around, let us say, so 1 did not do it because.
10 found it a waste, as it does not affect me in the same way
11 that it does others, as mushrooms do not affect me in the same
12 way as it does others. 1 am not saying I am unique, the only
13 person in the world, but —
14 Q. That trailer that you stayed in with Ms. Heard got smashed up,
15 did it not?
16 A. Abathroom sconce got smashed up. 1 did get very I was
17 Very upset at being yet again treated as the, pardon the
18 expression, the turd in the punch bowl, and that was quite
19 unpleasant. did not feel that I deserved to be screamed at,
20 demeaned, and treated like garbage for having done something
21 that I elt was right and correet. So, during the height of
22 the argument, I punched the glass art deco light fixture in
23 the bathroom, above the bathroom mirror, and smashed it.
24 Q. The trailer was very, very badly damaged the next day. There
25 was a wall lamp, a sconce as you call it, hanging off the.

2 wall, but there was mess everywhere, absolutely everywhere.
3 You had trashed the trailer?
4 A. Tam going to have to say, no, I did not.
5 Q Youjust limited your anger to tearing off the wall lamp; is
6 that right?
7 A. No, Idid not tear off the wall lamp, Ms. Wass. I punched the
8 lighting fixture, the glass around the bulb
9 Q Allright. Do you remember Kirsty Sexton coming into the
10 trailer the next morning?
11 A. Ido not remember Kirsty Sexton coming into the trailer the
12 next morning. 1 remember going to the manager of Hicksville.
13 Q. Yes, with your security?
14 A. lam sorry?
15 Q. With your security team?
16 A No.
17 Q. Were your sceurity team there?
18 A. Yes, Thad security there, but they ——
19 Q. Sorry, you carry on. You were about to tell us you went to
20 the manager?
21 A. Yes, all by myself. I did not feel threatened so I did not
22 need a security team to go talk to the manager. 1 found the
23 manager and I said, "I am sorry, but I broke a lighting
24 fixture in the trailer and I will pay for any damage there is.
25 Tam terribly sorry.” The manager came over to the trailer,
[Page 244]

--- Page 76 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 he came in, he had a look at the fixture, and he said, "No
3 problem”. He left for about ten minutes, he came back with
4 another fixture, and he screwed it on above the light bulb.
5 Q. Yousce, that is not what happened at all. In fact, your
6 security team negotiated, or had to negotiate, with the owners
7 about sorting out the much more extensive damage that you had
8 done, and they were offering money to them. The owners became
9 very upset because do you remember a wedding party was due to
10 arrive within a couple of hours?
11 A. Ido havea vague memory, yes, that we had to get out of
12 there, yes.
13 Q. The owners were saying, "You cannot just pay for it; we have
14 people coming in two hours.”
15 A. They never expressed that to me. As I'said, I spoke with the
16 ‘manager, brought him to the trailer, showed him the damage,
17 and then he went to his office and returned with the
18 replacement bulb.
19 Q. You have told us that and I understand your account on that.
20 A. Okay, Iwill not say it again then.
21 Q. There is no need to say it again unless there is anything new
22 that you need to add. That trailer was trashed by you because
23 of the physical fight that you had with Ms. Heard in the
24 trailer on the night before, the night that you had made the
25 objections about Kelly Sue. That is what I suggest happened?

2 A. The trailer was not trashed.
3 MS.WASS: Your Lordship, there are matters dealt with in the
4 confidential part of his case.
5 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: I have said that it would be convenient if the
6 private part of the hearing could be dealt with as
7 conveniently as possible, in other words, in one session.
8 MS.WASS: Yes, absolutely.
9 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: If that means you taking out of order —
10 MS. WASS: It does, because
11 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: — then I understand that, but I think the
12 priority should be to minimise the movement between public and
13 open.
14 MS. WASS: Iagree
15 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Public and private.
16 MS. WASS: I can deal with it all together towards the end of the
17 cross-examination.
18 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Thank you.
19 MS. WASS: Mr. Depp, you were very angry with Ms. Heard and,
20 amongst other things, you physically hit her and pushed her
21 around in that trailer that the two of you had rented, and
22 during the course of that struggle, things got broken and that
23 is how the trailer was trashed. What do you say about that?

2 you accept that you have referred to Ms. Heard and her
3 disapproval of your drink and drug habit and you have referred

6 Q. Can we go to file 7, tab 2B.
7 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: You say 2B?
8 MS. WASS: Yes, and I can see immediately that I have got the

2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Presumably, you saw a similarity in your relationship, the age
4 difference between you, possibly, because in that film,
5 Humphrey Bogart was considerably older than Lauren Bacall?
6 A. Yes, indeed. She was 19 and he was 45, I believe.
7 Q. Yes. as indeed there was a very large age difference between
8 you and Ms. Heard?
9 A Yes, enormous.
10 Q. Inany event, when we sce Steve, we know it is you?
11 A. Yes, I was Steve and she was --—
12 Q. Slim?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Right. Go over to the next page, please. Then at the bottom
15 of H23.3, this is, I suggest, a text exchange with her: "Your
16 display of guilt and matronliness as a lesbian camp counsellor
17 was plenty, but your future is on display.” That is you
18 sending a message to Slim, to Ms. Heard?
19 A. Yes, itis.
20 Q. And you describe, or you used the words "lesbian camp
21 counsellor"?
22 A. Yes, I used the words "lesbian camp counsellor" in the text.
23 Q. just thought you had denied ever using it, that is all?
24 A. No,no, did deny ever referring to her or calling her a
25 lesbian camp counsellor. However, I see here you are correct,

2 Tused that in a text, but the words were never uttered.
3 Q. Right. It does not actually make any difference whether they
4 were uttered or sent in a text.
5 A. Obviously, there are many things in a text. Iam agreeing
[3 with you that I made a mistake.
7 Q. Tam sure you will agree that that is a highly offensive
8 reference to her.
9 A. Yes, itis.
10 Q. And attacking people's sexuality -- disparaging descriptions
11 of people's sexuality.
12 A. Iwould say that was an ugly thing to do, an ugly thing to
13 write.

2 Q. "Amber and I not so good any more." You are saying, "If Amber
3 is good with it, its fine." You are just dealing with some
4 practical problem. Then you say, "Amber and I not so good any
5 more"?
6 A Yes
7 Q. This was ata time when you and Amber, Ms. Heard, were going
8 through a number of difficulties, mainly because of your drug
9 ingestion and alcohol consumption, do you agree?
10 A. No.
11 Q. Atpage 10, your sister replies to you: "She wants to talk to
12 me. She does not know what to do. Loves you, but does not
13 always what to do. She is worried about it all"; yes?
14 A. Yes,Iseethat
15 Q. And then you say, "It was not pleasant today. Iwas not aware
16 she had another God damn photo shoot tomorrow. That is really
17 why she fucking left. I don't need actress bullshit and her
18 fucking ambition." Do you remember yesterday that you said
19 that that phrase, "actress bullshit and fucking ambition’
20 referred to you trying to support her to get more serious
21 roles that did not objectify her. Do you remember that
22 evidence you gave yesterday?
23 A Yes. Ido

25 A. Yes, Ido stand by that. By referring to, if I may say,

2 "actress bullshit and ambition", though Ms. Heard was
3 concerned with, as I said yesterday, being objectified by
a directors, producers, the world at large, you know, having to
5 do nude scenes in films, we had talked quite a lot about -—
6 Q. Mr. Depp, you explained this yesterday. You stand by what you
7 said yesterday. 1 just wanted to establish whether you did
8 stand by what you said yesterday. Now we have seen the
9 context of the text, you say you did?
10 A Istandbyit.
11 Q Iwould like to move on if we may?
12 A. Please.
13 Q. Atpage 10 n the texts, there is a text to Mr. Bettany below
14 that text we have just looked at. If you go halfway down that
15 text, you say to him, "You may have to drink for me. I, of
16 course, pounded and displayed ugly colours to Amber on a
17 recent journey. 1am an insane person and not so fair-headed
18 after too much of the drink. Weed, pills, fine. Booze, my
19 capacity is too large and I won't stop. Ugly and sad. Oh,
20 how Tove it.” So, did you send that text to Mr. Bettany?
21 A. Yes. It appears so, yes.
22 Q. Could you go, remaining in file 6, to tab 148, please?

10 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: It does on yours, it does not on mine, but I
1 can add it.

15 describe the image. That is you, is it not?

19 Q. There is a bed. is there not, to the left of that photograph?

2 Q. Your shoes are not on, it is right to say.
3 A. Yes, ma'am.
4 Q. Your head is really, well, it does not look in a very
5 comfortable position; would you agree?
6 A Itishardto tell. Everything is very black, but it looks
7 like there is something here like a long, like a cushion from
8 a bed that my head is resting on. You can see it starts from
9 just above the knee and goes over. It looks like my head is
10 on a cushion.
11 Q. Ifyou have a look at the next page, you will see it looks
12 less like a cushion on the next page. In fact, on the third
13 page, you can see it is a solid object?
14 A. tis solid?
15 Q. Can you see that?
16 A. lam sory, Iam unable to distinguish that it is a solid
17 object. Ido not know what it is.

2 are talking about, is it, Mr. Depp, that object?
3 A. Yes. Honestly, I cannot tell what it is.
4 Q. No,lamjust trying to see if it is possible. That is what
5 you were talking about when you said you thought there was a
3 cushion or something?
7 A. When looked at the photograph, that is the only sense it
8 ‘made to me, yes.
9 Q Theonly?
10 A. Sense that it made to me.
11 Q. Itwould be sensible, if you were deciding to sleep on the
12 floor fully clothed, to have a cushion under your head,
13 Taceept that.
14 A Yes
15 Q. Do you accept, having looked at photograph 2, which shows that
16 object more clearly, and photograph 3, that it appears to be a
17 rectangular, solid object rather than a cushion?
18 A lamafraid I cannot —
19 Q. You cannot accept that?
20 A. No, just cannot just see.
21 Q. You cannot see, fair enough, but you accept that that is you
22 on the ground in that position?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. For the avoidance of doubt, if we go behind each of those
25 photographs, we see the metadata of those photographs at about

2 the level just below the first hole punch up?
3 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Which of the three photographs are you asking
4 about?
5 MS. WASS: The metadata is on the same position on each and all
6 three are taken on 18th July 2013. Do you see that, Mr. Depp?
7 Aldo.
8 Q. And there has been no challenge of that metadata so we can be
9 sure that that was a photograph taken of you on that date,
10 Now. you said in your witness statement that in July 2013, you
11 had another five-day stint in rehab and you had not been
12 drinking prior to the release of a film that you had done.
13 Shall I read the whole passage because you took issue with the
14 phrase or the word "rehab" yesterday?
15 A. Ifyou would. (Pause)
16 Q. Itis paragraph 24, my Lord, of the second witness statement,
17 but I will read it out. What you said is: "l remember that
18 before the release of The Lone Ranger in July 2013....", so
19 that is when these photographs were taken in July, so we are
20 talking about the same era; okay?
21 A Yes.
22 Q."...Thad another five-day stint in rehab and had not been
23 drinking prior to the release of the film." So that is true,
24 is it not, that you had a five-day stint in rehab? They are

2 A. Tlike to mix my words up a little every now and again.
3 I-- in normal circumstances, no one goes to rehab for five
4 days: they go into detox for a period of days. Rehab is
5 normally 30 to 90 to sometimes six months. So, I am sorry if
6 my difference does not agree with you.
7 Q ltis nothing to do with that, you took exception to the word,
8 Mr. Depp. Tam simply saying it is the word you chose in your
9 witness statement. Did you spend five days detoxifying in

10 July 2013?

11 A. Ispent five days in the same hospital, the same doctor, in

12 New York City, for five days.

13 Q. The same as the one you had done in -——

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. That is Mr. Richards's establishment, Keith Richards's

16 establishment?

17 A. Itis not his -- it was someone who Keith knew, this doctor,

18 and I had gone to Keith and told him that I was prepared to

19 stop, I wanted to stop drinking.

20 Q. And taking drugs?

21 A. Yes, and he helped me to ----

22 Q. Allright. So, this was the same place, this was basically

23 Mr. Richards had recommended to you, and you spent another

24 five days in July 2013. Ts it fair to say that in the summer

9 Q. There are many of these texts that indicate — let us just
10 look at one, over on page 11, since we are in this part of the

15 is you to her.

19 Q. "The only reason we go for the throat is love, was that a
20 reference to the fact that you would hold her by the throat
21 when you were in a rage from time to time?
22 A. No.

3 the brim and will remain so. I'm leaving but I will never go
4 anywhere, I will never go away, but we need to stay the course
5 and to help one another, not hit 95 miles an hour in three
6 seconds and go for each other's jugular. We need to be
7 stronger than that." Did you send that text?
8 A. Yes. Yes,it seems so.
9 Q. It scems from that text that you were going to be away. You
10 spent a lot of time apart, did you not, with your various film
11 ‘commitments over the time you were together?
12 A. Sometimes there were significant times apart, yes.
13 Q. And when you were apart, she would want to do things with
14 other people, see other people, go out with other people,
15 socialise; yes?
16 A. Yes, sure.
17 Q. Anddid this occasionally make you feel insecure?
18 A Occasionally, yes, it did.
19 Q. Because, I mean, we can go through it, if you like, but there
20 is a long series of texts over the next few pages, when she
21 asked whether it would — well, she told you she was thinking
22 about going to an Arctic Monkeys show in a small venue with
23 somebody from the cast of something she must have been working
24 in, and his girlfriend. And you found it, it made you feel
25 uncomfortable and she agreed not to go. That is my summary of

2 the texts. We can go through them, if you want, or
3 alternatively, you can look at them over the short adjournment
4 and then tell me, when you have had an opportunity to read
5 them, whether you agree or not. Shall we do it like that,
6 Mr. Depp? The texts go from page 11 to page 14, between you
7 and Ms. Heard, and it is what I am going to call the Arctic
8 Monkeys series of texts. Do you want to look at those over
9 lunch and then tell me whether you think I have summarised it
10 fairly?
11 A Ifyoulike, yes. I don't want to waste the court's time.

13 about another joke you cracked with Mr. Deuters on

7 Q. And your mother took a liking to Pistol, did she not, your
8 late mother?
9 A. My mother, yes, she met Pistol and, yes, she loved dogs.
10 Q. And you bought your mother a dog, which was called Boo?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And Boo stayed with your mother for a while, but I think your
13 ‘mother gave her back to you to look after?
14 A. Basically yes.
15 Q So, Imean, essentially, you had a dog, called Boo, and
16 Ms. Heard had a dog called Pistol?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And Boo, I think, had got problems, I think you have said
19 there, she has a major problem, in the text; yes?
20 A. She was relatively new and she was, the dog was not completely
21 house-trained. Ms. Heard was training the dog to not make
22 ‘mistakes.
23 Q. Well, the dog Boo, Boo had a problem, because Boo had eaten
24 some hash, some cannabis?
25 A. Yes.
[Page 260]

--- Page 92 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 Q Byaccident?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Quite alot of cannabis, about an ounce; would you agree with
5 that?
6 A. Iwould not say it was an ounce.
7 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Can we ask whether Boo had eaten some
8 cannabis?
9 THE WITNESS: Yes. Yes. the puppy got a hold of a little ball of
10 hashish and just scooped it up before I could get to it.
11 MS. WASS: Asa result of that, Ms. Heard was worried. was she
12 not, that Boo had some sort of brain injury?
13 A. It was something she liked to say, yes.
14 Q. She would say it, all right, I think we can leave it at that.
15 Could you go to page 15, please.
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Again, it may be that we have reached the place, Mr. Depp,
18 where we agree. But what I am going to suggest to you is that
19 Ms. Heard was quite regularly scolding you for drinking,
20 knowing that you had a history of alcohol abuse, and she was
21 really very strict, hence the word "lesbian camp counsellor”
22 that you used. On one occasion, on page 15, you are writing
23 to your sister, saying, it is the middle of page 15: "She was
24 a shit last night. No lovey-dovey note this morning, no
25 message. She's young and dumb, I'm old and dumb." Then

2 another text: "I made the grave mistake of asking if she
3 would mind if 1 had one glass of champagne only. Thad a half
4 glass with Christopher, because that's what he wanted.
5 I toasted him and sipped it. When she arrived at the Ritz
6 (reads to the words)... that made me feel ashamed, gross,
7 sad, stupid and diseased.” This was really an indication of
8 what things were like, was it not, Mr. Depp? If you wanted a
9 small amount of alcohol, she was very worried that this was
10 ‘going to lead to other things and it became an issu?
11 A. Itwasa way to control me.
12 Q. You think she was controlling you?
13 A. Ibelieve you used the word "strict", she was very strict.
14 Q Allright
15 A. I'mtwice her age, -—
16 Q. Twice her age, and not quite twice her size, but quite a lot
17 ——
18 A. Yes. didnot feel that lectures and berating or storming out
19 because I asked her if it would bother her if I had a glass of
20 champagne, or that she was already angry that I had half a
21 glass of champagne with Christopher Lee
22 Q. Yousee, Mr. Depp, Ms. Heard had seen alcohol turn you into
23 the monster, and she did not want it to happen, and she would
24 try to stop you drinking at all. That is why she had reached
25 this position.
[Page 262]

--- Page 94 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 A. Again, I cannot speak for her motivation exactly. But I can
3 say that she was very controlling in that way, very, very —
4 yes, it was as if you were being reprimanded by a camp
5 counsellor, I am sorry that I used that phrase with her, and
6 itis
7 Q. Would you look at a text on page 16, dated 29th October,
8 because the control, as you say, went both ways. It is the
9 second text from the bottom.
10 A Yes.
11 Q. Itis from you to Slim, which we know is Ms. Heard, it just
12 reads this: "Wholly crack horse, no God damn meetings, no
13 movies, why, why do you deviate from our agreement? What
14 species of meeting? Fuck it, just tell me when you get home."
15 A. Yes,Isee that.
16 Q. Did you send that text to Ms. Heard?

18 Q. Itappears so, does it not?
19 A. Ifitis, ifitis, yes, it appears that I did, it appears
20 that T did, but I do not know what the meaning or the context.

22 with. This is you to Mr. Deuters.

2 315t October 2013: "Amber is extremely upset and we're dying
3 Do you want to speak with her while you're there and give her
4 some perspective on me and what I am and what I am not", and
5 Mr. Deuters obeys, understood, "Yes, Twill" You say: "Ask

7 bother — sorry. you say, "IF it's not a bother”, thank you
8 Mr. Sherborne. Then you say: "Thanks. She thinks that my
9 Peruvian period has made me a monster, and that I am ruining
10 the relationship."
1A Yes.
12 Q. So, the Peruvian period is a reference to cocaine?
13 A. Yes, ma'am.
14 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Justa moment. Yes
15 MS. WASS: The monster is the person you turn into when you have
16 had too much Peruvian powder, cocaine?
17 THE WITNESS: She thinks that my Peruvian period has made me a
18 ‘monster and that T am ruining the relationship. Tam
19 referring to a Peruvian period.
20 Q. Did you send that text?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Did you ry to get clean afier this?
23 MR.SHERBORNE: My Lord, Ms. Wass did ask a question. Mr. Depp
24 was in the middle of answering it. Then, Ms. Wass just asked
25 him, while he was answering it, "did you send that text", and
[Page 264]

--- Page 96 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 then stopped him. Ido not know whether it would be helpful,
3 given he was asked the question, to be able to answer it
4 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Yes. Ms. Wass, could you go back to the
5 previous question. 1am afraid I have forgotten what it was.
6 MS. WASS: Ithink Ihave. Mr. Depp was trying to a question that
7 neither my Lord or I can remember. Perhaps Mr. Sherborne has
8 the question.
9 MR. SHERBORNE: lt is really his answers, not the questions that
10 are important, as your Lordship said, but at least he should
11 be able to give them.
12 THE WITNESS: In your question, that I am referring to, I am
13 trying to find where it is on the -—
14 MS. WASS: The Peruvian period text is on page 17.
15 A. Yes, Ihave found it, thanks. She thinks that my Peruvian
16 period has made me a monster and that | am running - ruining
17 the relationship. So, she is talking — 1 am talking about my
18 Peruvian period, so it is a period in time when I was using
19 cocaine. As I said, as I said to you yesterday, on occasion
20 and sometimes maybe it would last a couple of days or a few
21 days, depending on how things were. But what | am trying to
22 say is, your efforts to bring cocaine into every situation of
23 our relationship is ~ I understand what you are trying to do,
24 but I think it is important to acknowledge that I am talking
25 to him about my Peruvian period.

2 Q. Youtried to stop taking cocaine, but you lapsed. This was
3 the pattern, was it not?
4 A Ididnottryto stop and lapse. Istopped, and then if
5 1 felt like it or if it was needed in some way, I would use
6 it.
7 Q And
& MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Just a minute. Your answer is that did you
9 not try to stop and then lapse, but if you felt that you
10 needed to have cocaine
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. you would take it?
13 A YesmyLord,
14 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Right. Thank you.
15 MS. WASS: What you are saying in that text is that Ms. Heard
16 thought that your Peruvian period, i.e. when did you take
17 cocaine, has made you a monster?
18 THE WITNESS: "She thinks that my Peruvian period has made me a
19 monster”, yes.
20 Q. Yesterday, you gave us a variety of interpretations of what
21 the monster was. I suggested it was your, the rather dark
22 side to your character which came out under the influence of
23 drink or drugs. Are you able to say, since you wrote the
24 words in this text, what your definition of "monster" was
25 there?
[Page 266]

--- Page 98 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 A Well, did not say "the monster" in my text. I said "a
3 monster".
4 Q. Whats your definition of "a monster” in that text, please?
5 A My definition of it is that she thinks my Peruvian period has
6 ‘made me a monster. You would have to ask her.
7 Q. Well, you have written this word. Was she saying to you -—
8 A Youare-—
9 Q. -- you are a monster when you have taken cocaine?
10 A. She would say that I was "the monster" at any time it suited
11 her fancy or it suited her argument, and it was not the case,
12 Tam not a multi-personality. So, Iam just telling him that
13 she thinks my Peruvian period has made me into a monster and
14 Tam ruining the relationship. So, her constant harping on
15 whatever I may have decided to ingest, she is saying, affected
16 her more than it affected me. That I became the monster, she
17 said.
18 Q. You became the monster after taking cocaine?
19 A. Thatis just not true.
20 Q. Thatis what she was saying, that is what you are saying she
21 has said?
22 A. Oh yes, that is what she is saying, yes.
23 Q. Ifthatis correct, and itis the interpretation that you have
24 given to that text, how could Ms. Heard possibly have been
25 involving herself in chopping up lines of cocaine for you, as

2 her habit was, as you suggest? It just does not fit in with

4 A. Atacertain point —-
5 Q ltisjustalie, is it not?
6 A. Excuseme?
7 Q. That was a lie when you said she was chopping up cocaine for
8 you, she desperately disapproved of you taking cocaine, she
9 saw that it tumed you into the monster, and that is why you
10 wrote that text?
11 A. Iappreciate your attempts to get that info cross.
12 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Depp, your comments about Ms. Wass's
13 questions, I can understand. But what I want to understand is
14 Your answer to the question.
15 A. Yes,sir, Tunderstand - I apologise if my way of getting to
16 the answer —-
17 Q. Leave out the compliments to Ms. Wass's questions and just
18 give me your answer?
19 A. Certainly. It was Ms. Heard’ belief that I became a monster.
20 She was the only person that has ever brought that up, that
21 notion that I am a monster when I drink, that I am a monster
22 when I took cocaine, that I was a monster when I smoked
23 marijuana. It was more than a concern of hers. It was a
24 weapon, and it was used constantly. She grabbed hold of the
25 word and held on, hell bent for leather, that it would stick.

6 going to come to after lunch, then that would be a convenient
7 moment,
8 MS. WASS: Can I take up Mr. Depp's offer that he reads the
9 exchanges about the Arctic Monkeys, to see whether we need to
10 spend more time on that. Mr. Depp, is that still an offer on
11 the table, that you would read those texts between pages 11
12 and 167
13 A. Certainly, yes.
14 Q. Iwill give you the summary again, and you can tell me whether
15 I have that wrong. Thank you.
16 A. Absolutely, thank you.

2 I spoke to the court usher during the mid-morning break, and.
3 indicated that I would be making a request to my Lord, which
1 Inow make, which is that those of our legal team could have
5 access to the court over the short adjournment. 1 know that
3 the normal answer to that sort of request of the court staff
7 is that itis not their policy because of security matters.
8 The bundling in this case is becoming a bit of an issue, and
9 taking all of our papers out and comparing the bundles is
10 going to be an enormous job, there is not room to do it in our
11 room. If we undertake that the court will not be left
12 unattended, i.e. one person from our team will be here at any
13 given time, would my Lord allow us to remain in court until
14 quarter past two in order to perform this task?
15 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Give me a moment. (Pause) Ms. Wass, you are
16 understandably concerned about your papers. The claimant's
17 side might want to have somebody in court, am sure
18 unnecessarily, but just to keep an eye on their own papers.
19 If somebody from the claimants legal team is willing to do
20 that --—-

22 would be absolutely no objection to that whatsoever

2 Q. Letme tell you what I am suggesting the summary was. It

3 appeared that you and Ms. Heard were apart from each other,

4 she had been invited by somebody called Jim to go to an Arctic

5 Monkeys concert?

6 A Yes, maam.

7 Q. There were, in fact, four tickets available, the Jim

8 character, his girlfriend, Ms. Heard, and originally there was

9 one for you. You obviously were not able to attend, but there
10 was a suggestion that Ms. Heard could take someone from your
1 security?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Yes, and you expressed, during those text exchanges, a degree
14 of anxiety about why she wanted to go and you found it rather
15 suspicious?
16 A. Ifound it suspicious to a degree. Iwas concerned more than
17 anything. She had, Ms. Heard had not begun filming as yet and
18 these were virtual strangers so I voiced my concern.
19 Q. Was your concer bom out of jealousy?
20 A. No, my concern was pure concern for Ms. Heard.
21 Q. What was the concern about her going to a concert with people
22 that she was about to be working with and a person who was
23 part of your security team; what was the problem?
24 A. There was no problem. In fact, I believe I even told her a
25 few times, I said, "Go ahead and go."

[Page 272]

--- Page 104 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 Q. Then you expressed your concerns and in fact she did not go in
3 the end, did she?
4 A. No, it appears she did not go.
5 Q. Shedid not go and you said this: "You lay a gauntlet before
6 ‘me that you know is the very species of danger that will
7 always attract me into a very tempting test." Were you
8 referring to your jealousy?
9 A. Ido not quite know what I was referring to there. Could you
10 read it again? Tam so sorry.
11 Q. Yes. Thisis to you to Ms. Heard. It is a long interchange
12 about should she go, should she not go, whether you tell her
13 to go, and then she said, "No, I will not go", which is why I
12 did not want to read every single question and answer out.
15 You end by saying: "You [that is Ms. Heard] lay a gauntlet
16 before me that you know is the very species of danger that
17 will always attract me into a very tempting test."
18 A. It does not sound like I am referring to that incident for
19 some reason, but I do not know what gauntlet I am talking
20 about.
21 Q. Allright, we will have to leave that one as it is. Can I
22 then go 0 2014. Your consumption of drugs in 2014 was still
23 ongoing — cocaine, alcohol, yes, do you agree?
24 A. Ongoing? Ido not know. I cannot specify 2014.

2 A Butlam sure it would not be a surprise to me that I would
3 use.
4 Q Now, Iam going to suggest that a pattem developed in your
5 relationship with Ms. Heard, and there would be a trigger, all
6 right, and that trigger could be either you became jealous or
7 she would try to prevent you from taking drink or drugs, and
8 the trigger would cause you to go on a binge. By "binge", do
9 you know what I mean?
10 A. Yes, Ido.
11 Q. Yes, of course you do. That trigger would cause you to go on
12 a binge and you would convince yourself that the bingeing was
13 Ms. Heard's fault; she made you doit. Is that a pattern that
14 you recognise?
15 A. recognise it not as a pattern, but I recognise that -- there
16 were quite a lot of times when Ms. Heard could stay on a
17 subject for quite a long time in a discussion or an argument
18 and it became this sort of circular beast that you could not
19 arrive -- you would always arrive back where you began. So it
20 was very frustrating at times and unpleasant at times. 1am
21 not blaming her for my weaknesses as far as drug use or
22 drinking. However, I can honestly say that the frustration
23 and the inability to connect to one another in the way that we
24 should have, T found deeply disturbing and it seemed to go on
25 and on and on, so, yes, I would then

2 Q Goonabinge?

3 A Twould get very — I would drink to try to numb the pain, and

4 —

5 Q lam calling that a binge -—

6 A. Certainly

7 Q. — but you are expressing it in another way. Once you

8 started on the drinking to numb yourself, you would later

9 convince yourself that Ms. Heard had made you do that; it was
10 her fault that you had weakened and binged. You blamed her?
11 A. could possibly have blamed her at times.
12 Q. When this syndrome arose, that is to say, argument, whether it
13 was about jealousy or drug taking, followed by you going on a
14 binge, when the whole thing was over, when the whole explosion
15 was over, you would disappear, would you not? You would just
16 disappear to get away from her?
17 A. There was a time or two where I texted her and said, "Tam
18 going to stay at a hotel tonight because I cannot deal with
19 it"
20 Q. Youhad to get away from her?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. She became extremely worried, did she not, that she did not
23 know where you were and you were in a state of either
24 inebriation or excessive drug consumption. She was very, very
25 worried. She used to get quite frantic with worry on those

2 occasions when you did disappear?
3 A. She would indeed get quite frantic with, as you say, worry,
4 and she would get indeed quite jealous that I was out cheating
5 on her.
6 Q Well, we agree about the first half. The second halfis
7 slightly more complicated, but we will come to that when we
8 look at March 2015. But just going back, then, to 2014,
9 Yesterday, you told us in court that you had taken drugs with
10 Marilyn Manson twice?
11 A. Two, three times maybe.
12 Q. Butit was years ago, long before the relationship with
13 Ms. Heard?
14 A. Infact, before I was with Ms. Heard, I had not touched
15 cocaine in probably — I am trying to think of my age at that
16 time, which was —
17 Q. Ido not want to prevent you saying anything, but your
18 evidence yesterday was that you had taken drugs with
19 Marilyn Manson twice. Now you have said that might have been
20 three times and understand that, but that this had been
21 before your relationship with Ms. Heard. Do you stick by
22 that?
23 A. Myrecollection is that whenever I did, let us say, a line of
24 cocaine with Manson, I believed it was before Ms. Heard and
25 Twere fully involved, let us say.

3 involved by February or March 2014?

6 A. Yes, we were.
7 Q. Can you go to the text schedule at bundle 6, behind divider

2 coke/booze binge. Can you help? He needs to come home. We
3 have no reason to fight. He just aims all his anger at me
a when he's on it. Don't know what to do."
5 Do you realise now, or do you think now, having read
[3 those texts, that perhaps you were on a binge with
7 Marilyn Manson in 2014, February?
8 A. Iwould say that is what Ms. Heard believed -—
9 Q Right, well, let us read on
10 MR. SHERBORNE: Hold on —
11 THE WITNESS: Iam sorry, go ahead.
12 MR. SHERBORNE: Sorry, Ms. Wass asked the question, "Do you
13 believe that you therefore were on a binge?" Mr. Depp was
14 trying to answer it. He said, "I believe that is what
15 Ms. Heard believed" and was then actually going to explain
16 whether he did, and Ms. Wass stopped him and moved on. With
17 respect, if the question is going to be put to him to suggest
18 that he is not telling the truth when he made his statement
19 yesterday about how many times and when he had taken drugs
20 with Mr. Manson, then he should have the opportunity to deal
21 with it.
22 MR.JUSTICENICOL: Yes.
23 MS. WASS: lagree, carry on
24 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Perhaps you could ask the question again.
25 MS. WASS: Having seen this text — and we can read more, if it

2 would help you, if you would like me to defer the question
3 until we have read more of them — do you agree that it
a appears that you were on a drugs binge with Marilyn Manson?
5 A. Itappears to me that Ms. Heard believed that I was on a drug
6 binge with Marilyn Manson. As to how she would have the exact
7 information of what I was doing with Marilyn Manson at the
8 time is a mystery to me.
9 Q. Let us move on alittle bit and see if we can fathom this out.
10 A Good. Okay.
11 Q. She then says to your sister, "If I leave, I am not sure we
12 will be able to come back from it and I don't want to leave:
13 him when he is like this, in that state, when he just has the
14 echoes of his own mind bouncing around in his head. It is
15 terrible."
16 Your sister asks, "Where are the kids?" Ms. Heard says,
17 "At their mums. He went to drop Lily Rose off this morning
18 and has not been back since. I called the guards to make sure
19 at least one of them got here. Sean did."
20 ‘Then over the page, she tells your sister at the top
21 line that Sean - that is one of your guards - picked her up.
22 ‘Then she says, "Not sure who dropped her off, but I think it
23 was JD and Manson with security. They never came back after
24 that." Then your sister said, "Do you want to come to the
25 office to talk?" and Ms. Heard said, "Its okay, I am sure

2 he's at Manson's, but 1 am worried about how his state and
3 health will be in the next few days. He needs help. He
4 thinks he has no problem. He does not have it in under
5 control, The coke is just so har" — but it must be "hard" —
[3 “on us or him. It makes him believe he is mad about me and
7 everything."
8 A. "Madat me about everything."
9 Q "Mad at me about everything." Then your sister says, "I dont
10 love any of it. Worry about everything. I really want to be
11 able to talk with him." Did your sister express anxiety to
12 you about your drug intake at around this time?
13 A. Mysister Christi has over many, many years, since my youth,
14 had a number of worries about my consumption, growing up.
15 Yes, she talked to me many times over the course of my life
16 and, yes, with Ms. Heard, we did speak about it. 1 think she
17 and Ms. Heard’ ability to speak to one another stopped not
18 long after this,
19 Q. Atthe bottom of page 22, "He's been on a 24 hour plus binge
20 with Manson." Over the page, your sister says, "I understand
21 a lot of life things these days." Ms. Heard says, "I dont
22 know what to do. hate that he always aims at me. I don't
23 want to break —
24 MR JUSTICE NICOL: Sorry, can we just go back to the bottom of
25 page 22? "He's been on a 24 hour plus binge with Manson."
[Page 280]

2 ‘That appears to be a reference to you, Mr. Depp.

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. Were you saying that you do not know the basis on which

5 Ms. Heard was speaking and saying that you were on a 24-hour

6 binge with Mr. Manson, that you do not know the basis of that?

7 A. Itbecame chronic. It became a regular thing that she would

8 always say — that was her go-to. If Twas not around, I was

9 somewhere on a binge with somebody, getting loaded, and she is
10 speculating that I am getting loaded or on a binge with Manson
11 for over 24 hours if she does not know where I am or what I am
12 doing and she is worried. She says that 1 am on a binge with
13 Manson, but there is nothing to prove — 1 mean, there is no
14 way 10
15 MS. WASS: Do you remember being on a binge with Manson in
16 February 20147
17 A. No, no, donot. This case -- I remember this morning very
18 well. Manson and I did in fact take my daughter to school.
19 Q. Sothat part of it fits in. That part of the text that she is
20 sending to Christi fits; do you agree?
21 A. Yes, Iwas with Manson, taking my daughter to school, yes.
22 Yes, and then we were together.
23 Q. You and Mr. Manson?
24 A. Yes. Mr. Manson and I were together for probably a couple of
25 hours, a couple of hours after that, at his house, and then

2 I went back to my house on Sweetzer Avenue.
3 Q. As faras you are concemed, this was Ms. Heard just worrying
4 about something which had never happened at al; is that
5 right?
6 A. think she is taking a guess at what is happening.
7 Q Right
8 A. Idonot believe that she has the facts to -—
9 Q. Well, what I want to know is, do you remember at all whether
10 ‘you were taking drugs with Mr. Manson or not?
11 A. I remember smoking marijuana with Mr. Manson, yes.
12 Q. What about anything else?
13 A No, donot remember that.
14 Q. Ms. Heard is talking about cocaine, coke, she calls it?
15 A Yes, she talks about it quite a lot.
16 Q. Thats because you were taking quite a lot, you see?
17 A. Thats very debatable.
18 Q. Do you have a problem remembering some of the things you were
19 doing at this time because of your excessive consumption of
20 alcohol?
21 A. No. If you do not mind my saying so, I would say that for
22 someone who has been quite self-destructive for the majority
23 of his life, I ended up pretty lucky and my brain still
24 functions quite well - luckily.
25 Q. The dayafter this exchange about you and Mr. Manson taking

2 ‘your daughter to school and then not coming back again, you
3 obviously had an argument with Ms. Heard. We can see that on
a page 25, the top text, "Amber and I hit the wall hard"?
5 A Pages?
6 Q Yes, the top text?
7A Yes
8 Q Then Whitney intervenes and says, "Johnny, please come home.
9 Sis does not want to hash anything, she just wants to be near
10 you and to know that you are okay. Please do not prolong her
11 pain’; yes?
12 A Yes, Iseethat
13 Q. Thatis from Sis — Whitney to you — and she is referring to
14 Sis as her sister, which is Miss Amber Heard?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Yousay, "I'm good, just can't deal anymore. She's crossed
17 the line again, always too much. She told me she was leaving
18 again and she did. She's made the choice. A person needs to
19 think before they go squirrely. So fucking sad. I have never
20 done anything but love her."
21 Then Whitney says, "Hammer, she doesn't want to leave
22 you. She was so sad yesterday. 1 had to drag her out of
23 Eighty yesterday. Im so sorry. I thought it would be good
24 for her to get some air and we didn't know when you would be
25 back. She didnt want to leave, but T pulled her out. So

2 please don't be mad at her for leaving, be mad at me." That
3 was an exchange that was happening the day after you dropped
1 your daughter at school. Changing the subject, your daughter
5 recognised at this time, did she not, that Ms. Heard was a
6 good influence on you?
7 A. Atthe time, my daughter, I thought it was very — I thought
8 it was very brave, courageous and big of her, very
9 sophisticated and smart of her to attempt to accept Ms. Heard
10 into her life, and the same for my son. They did their best
11 to, and they did -—
12 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I think the question, Mr. Depp, was that your
13 daughter recognised at about this time -- we are talking about
14 February 2014 - that Ms. Heard was a good influence on you?
15 A. She believed that at the time.
16 Q. Do you agree with that statement?
17 A. Yes, she believed that at the time.
18 MS. WASS: Just looking at page 25 of the texts, your daughter to
19 You, "You've been a better dad to Jack and I since she has
20 been around and she was helping with the alcohol problem.
21 just see what a positive effect she's had on you and I'm
22 afraid those things will leave with her. Please don't write
23 her off right now. She may surprise you and explain herself”
24 You say to Lily Rose, "I'm not going back to booze. We will
25 sce what happens with her”; all right?
[Page 284]

--- Page 116 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Now, ought tojust complete this series. At the top of 26,
4 what about you as a dad? "You've been so much better since
5 she's been around. We have talked about how, for a couple of
6 years, you weren't around for us and that changed when Amber
7 came into your life. I don't want to go back to that"?
8 A. Isce that.
9 Q. She says again, "But you have to acknowledge and know what a
10 good influence she's been and the fact that she's changed you
11 for the better. You see that, right?" All right? So that is
12 it from your daughter to you?
13 A. Yes, and this is 4th February.
14 Q. 4th February?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. On the following day, your sister sends you three short texts,
17 the first one at 7.38, "Stop drinking.” Then, at a few
18 minutes later, "Stop coke.” Then almost immediately
19 afterwards, "Stop pills." So, this is what you were saying
20 about your sister constantly over the course of your life
21 being concerned about you?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Now in May 2014, you were going to have another attempt at
24 detox and rehab, or whatever you prefer to call it?
25 A. Ido not know. I cannot remember exactly when it was.

2 Q. You were living in Boston at the time, do you remember that,
3 making a film?
4 A. Was that 20147 Yes, I was making Black Mass in Boston.
5 Q. You were scheduled to be there for three months?
6 A Yes
7 Q. May, June, July. You consulted a Dr. Kipper in May 2014?
8 A Yes
9 Q Do you agree? Would you take file 4, please.
10 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Just a moment, please, file 4?
11 MS. WASS: Tab 123. It should have page F736 at the bottom.
12 A. Yes, | have that.
13 Q. Anditis notes from Dr. Kipper. It is headed "Johnny Depp -
12 initial consultation” and the date is 22nd May 2014; do you
15 agree?
16 A YesIdo. Yes.
17 Q. "Iwas asked by Mr. Depp to come to Boston to consult on his
18 ‘general medical situation. Mr. Depp is a 50 year-old male”,
19 he gives your date of birth, "who has had a life-long history
20 of self-medicating behaviours involving multiple substances of
21 abuse. These include alcohol, opiates, benzodiazapines and
22 stimulants", and he puts next to "stimulants", "cocaine"?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. "He has also had insomnia since childhood. For this problem
25 he takes Roxicodone and has been on this medication for over
[Page 286]

--- Page 118 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 two years. He suffered from ADHD as a child and has been
3 given Adderall recently that dramatically improved his focus
4 and sense of calm. He admits to an anxiety syndrome and takes
5 Klonopin 2m daily in the morning and has done so for several
[3 years." Then you also take other drugs there. There is no
7 family history or coronary artery disease. "He has smoked
8 cigarettes for most of his life and he also takes Red Bull,
9 coffee and sugar to increase his focus and sense of calm. He
10 also has a history of THC intake that calms him." That is
11 tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredients in cannabis?
12 A. Yes,
13 Q. There are some other medical matters that are discussed that
14 Iwill not trouble you with, unless you think they are
15 important. At the bottom of the page, it says: "He is living
16 in Boston for the next three months acting in the film and has
17 no extended time to participate in these exams. He would like
18 to schedule these diagnostics in the mid-summer when he
19 retums to his home in Los Angeles.” Then, there is a bit
20 about your family life. Over the following page, under
21 “Impression”.
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. "Primary dopamine imbalance, ADHD, bipolar one, depression
24 secondary to above, insomnia, chronic substance abuse
25 disorder.” So, chronic obviously means long-term, over a long

2 period of time, rather than one acute episode. Then, chronic

3 nicotine use, and he puts in place a plan. Do you agree, and

4 the plan was that you were going to go for a detox with

5 Dr. Kipper when the filming had finished.

6 A Yes

7 Q. In your witness statement, Mr. Depp, you said -- and my Lord

8 itis paragraph 21 for your reference -- "Ms. Heard's attempt

9 to portray me as a general drug addict is so far from accurate
10 and she knows that." You suggest in that statement that the
11 only drug you have been addicted to is Roxicodone. You went
12 on to state in your witness statement: "I have taken other
13 drugs during the course of my life and I did take other drugs.
14 during the course of our relationship, but I have never
15 suffered with addiction to those drugs.” Now, Iam going to
16 suggest that Dr. Kipper's assessment contradicts that, and
17 there was multiple substance abuse, chronic substance abuse,
18 including alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine,
19 stimulants. Now, did Dr. Kipper get that wrong?
20 A. No. Idonot —no, I do not believe he got it wrong, because
21 he got information from --—
22 Q. From you?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Exactly. The idea was that you were going to clean up your
25 act?

[Page 288]

--- Page 120 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 A Iwas, yes, | was going to clean up my act.
3 Q. Putting it in -—
4 A. Yes. Iwas quite addicted to the Roxicodone, which — the
5 reason that I began taking the Roxicodone was from an injury,
6 a stunt injury on a film in London.
7 Q. Again, forgive me for interrupting, you said you were addicted
8 to Roxicodone, I do not think we need to go through the entire
9 reason why this came about, if you do not mind.
10 A. tis just that it tates incorrectly why I was taking
11 Roxicodone.
12 Q. Allright. So, we can make a note that you do not agree with
13 that. Now, you were working in Boston. Ms. Heard was working
14 in New York at the time in May, was she not?
15 A. Ifyou sayso, yes.
16 Q Well—
17 A. Idonot recall, again, I do not recall dates very well.
18 Q. Ican refresh your memory. She was working on a film called
19 the Adderall Diaries
20 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: What diaries?
21 MS. WASS: The Adderall Diaries, opposite an actor called James
22 Franco?
23 THE WITNESS: Yes.
24 Q. Aman possibly closer to Ms. Heard's age than yours?
25 A. Definitely.

2 Q. And Ms, Heard played the love interest of James Franco's
3 character?
4 A. Thave not seen the film, but I will take your word for it.
5 Q. Thatsituation, that type of situation where she was involved
6 in romantic scenes with other actors always provoked you to
7 become jealous?
8 A. No, not always, no.
9 Q. On this occasion, it provoked you to become jealous?
10 A. It provoked me to -- let's use the word "jealous" — it
11 provoked me to become jealous because of what Ms. Heard had
12 previously told me about her experience of working with
13 Mr. Franco on a film called Pineapple Express. So, it shocked
12 me that she was suddenly so friendly and happy with him.
15 Q. Right. So, you thought something might be up?
16 A. She told me many things that were very, very negative about
17 Mr. Franco and that he had tried to kiss her and tried
18 sexually, made sexual advances towards her on the previous
19 film they had done together and that she said he was a creep,
20 you know, he was a rapist, that kind of thing.
21 Q. She said he was a rapist?
22 A. She said that he was quite aggressive in his advances towards
23 her.
24 Q. Arapist, she did not use that word, surely?
25 A. Well, Ido not recall that the word was "rapist", but what she
[Page 290]

--- Page 122 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 is doing is she is —
3 Q. Mr. Depp, you made an extremely important statement just now,
a that Ms. Heard told you that James Franco was a rapist?
5 A. Pardon me for using the word.
6 Q. Youmade that up on the spot, did you not?
7 A Nojitis just the word that came out for the actions
8 described of Mr. Franco by Ms. Heard to me, which was sexual
9 advances which were him leaning into her and saying "I going
10 to kiss you now" and, you know, she had to sort of run from
11 his advances at one point and that he was kind of non-stop and
12 she felt he was creepy and rapey, is the word. So, if I said
13 a rapist, it is because the word "rapey” was used to describe
14 Mr. Franco and his behaviour.
15 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: That was the word that she used, was it?
16 THE WITNESS: Rapey, yes.
17 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Thank you.
18 MS.WASS: You were uncomfortable, if I can use a neutral term, as
19 soon as you heard that she was going to be making another film
20 with James Franco, were you not?
21 THE WITNESS: I was uncomfortable with that, yes, because it was
22 quite inconsistent with the feelings that she had told me of.
23 Q. You told us before that you did not interfere with Ms. Heard's
24 scripts or anything like that; is that sill your evidence?
25 A. Ido not know what "interfere with the scripts" means.

2 Q. You would say, before she took a part, what does this film
3 involve, advising her -—
4 MR.SHERBORNE: My Lord, Mr. Depp's evidence yesterday was, he
5 said he would not interfere unless he was asked to do so. So,
6 if Ms. Wass is going to put his evidence to him, then it would
7 be more helpful if she put it to him correctly.
8 MS. WASS: There you are, Mr. Depp. Do you agree with that? You
9 would not interfere unless you were asked, unless she asked
10 you to advise her?
11 THE WITNESS: Thatis correct. Whenever she asked me for my
12 advice, or asked me what I thought about a project, I would
13 give her my opinion and I would give her my concerns, and
14 Twould give her advice on how to handle with her agents or
15 ‘her manager.
16 Q. Your concems about romantic scenes were quite considerable,
17 were they not? You know what I mean by "romantic scenes"
18 A Yes, Ido. Well, given that Ms. Heard, as I had said
19 Yesterday, as | testified yesterday, Ms. Heard was
20 uncomfortable being thought of as a sex object and she was
21 hoping to do better films with more meat to the par, if you
22 will, and did not want to be objectified and did not want to,
23 have to do nude scenes any more. So I, and I of course was
24 uncomfortable with the idea of her doing nudity, as I think
25 that — well, it does not matter
[Page 292]

--- Page 124 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 Q. Okay. Can you take up, please, bundle §, and tab 73.
3 A. Somy.itisa bit of a scavenger hunt. Yes, I have it.
4 Q. Itis an e-mail from Ms. Heard to her then assistant, Kate
5 James, dated 10th May 2014,
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Subject: "Oneliner. Hey there, can you do me a favour,
8 please, can you please be sure you don't send Nathan” -- that
9 is Nathan Holmes —- "or Christie" -- your sister Christie --
10 “or anyone on Johnny's team the one-liner of my schedule.
11 1 do not want them to see a one-line breakdown that mentions
12 anything romantic or anything that could Johnny to lose it"
13 there is probably a word missing there -- "you know. Please
12 be careful, we just sent the DOOD that does not explain what
15 the scenes are in any way."
16 Can you think of any reason why Ms. Heard would not want
17 you to have the schedule of her romantic scenes?
18 A. Yes. It would make sense is she felt it would upset me. But
19 itis quite, slightly — it is a littl bit of a deception.
20 Q. Itisalittle of a deception and she was worried you were
21 going to lose it, that is the word. Can you imagine why she
22 thought you might lose it; can you help us with that? Maybe
23 you cannot help us.
24 A. think what she is stating is pretty clear, she does not want
25 ‘me to lose it, meaning does not want me to get jealous and

2 have it turn into an argument.

3 Q. And lose your temper?

4 A Well, be upset, yes.

SQ Loseit, is actually short for losing your temper, is it not?

6 No?

7 A Yes. Yes. But yes.

8 Q You hada telephone call before the night you met up with

9 Ms. Heard to travel back to Los Angeles, and I think you
10 arranged to charter a plane, that was going to pick Ms. Heard
11 up in Boston, where she had been filming with Mr. Franco, and
12 ‘you would be picked up by the same plane in New York, where
13 ‘you were filming, and the two of you would be flown back to
14 Los Angeles?
15 A. Actually, she was in New York and I was in Boston.
16 Q. Sorry, I got that wrong. Let me start again. She was in New
17 York and you were picked up in Boston, and the two of you flew
18 back to Los Angeles?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And it was a private plane that had been chartered?
21 A Yes, maam,
22 Q. The night before you were due to meet up, did you have a
23 heated discussion on the telephone with Ms. Heard about what
24 was happening with James Franco, the scenes she was doing with
25 James Franco?

[Page 294]

2 A Idonot recall, but itis highly likely.
3 Q What happened was that Ms. Heard got on the plane in New York,
4 as you said, the plane flew to Boston, and you arrived in a
s car, were driven in a car, but you did not get out of the car,
[3 did you; you stayed on the runway in that car for some
7 considerable time?
8 A. How long, a considerable time?
9 Q. Well, you knew the acroplane was waiting to load and take off.
10 A. Aswearrived - any aeroplane, when you allowed into the area
1 where the planes are and they drop us at the plane, there is
12 usually quite a bit of time to load the luggage into the cargo
13 area. So, there are a lot of times when I will stay, sit in
14 the car and continue smoking my cigarette, you know, before
15 1 get on the plane. As when you are on the ground, you are
16 not allowed to smoke on the plane, until you are airborne, for
17 obvious reasons.
18 Q. On this occasion, as you were waiting on the tarmac in your
19 chauffeur-driven car, you were taking drugs, were you not?
20 A. Tamsorry, I thought T just explained it to you. As is the
21 habit I smoke before, smoking in the car — do you want to
22 talk, or -- you can continue if you want.
23 Q. Letus clarify where the dispute is between us. You say you
24 were smoking cigarettes?
25 A. Tsaid Iwas smoking, normally I smoke, T am smoking a

2 cigarette before I get on the plane, so I am sitting in the
3 car smoking. Or maybe I was on the telephone, on a
4 conversation with someone, any number of things. But to just
5 assume naturally that I was doing drugs is a little bit ----
6 Q. Tamasking you
7 A. ——acheap shot, I would say.
8 Q. Tam asking you -- I am sorry you think it is a cheap shot,
9 but I hope by the time you hear what has been said about this
10 incident you will want to retract that suggestion.
11 A. That would be great
12 Q. You were taking drugs on that time before the Boston plancs,
13 do you agree with that suggestion or not?
14 A. Iwas in Boston, is where Dr. Kipper and nurse Debbie Lloyd
15 came. It had been agreed to, I had agreed to and promised my
16 sister, who had met with Dr. Kipper, that I was going to kick
17 the Roxicodone. So, Twas addicted to a very strong narcotic,
18 and that was known by everyone, and it was also known by
19 everyone that I had agreed to stop, and so we were in
20 preparation to go to the Bahamas for the detox.
21 Q. Had you had alcohol before getting on the planc?
22 A. Not that I recall, but normally when we get on a plane,
23 everybody has a drink, yes,
24 Q. Do you remember this at all, this incident?
25 A. Tamafraid I do not specifically remember this incident.

2 1 can only say that there had been many tarmacs and many
3 planes, and many SUVs.
4 Q. Allright. Let us see if this plane journey is any different
5 from any of the others. Ms. Heard was already on the plane,
6 your staff that travelled with you were Stephen Deuters; yes?
7A Yes
8 Q. Jerry Judge?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And Nathan Holmes?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. The man who you said would supply drugs to you from time to
13 time, but who is not a witness in this case; is that right?
14 A Yes, if he was asked
15 Q. And by the time you got on to the plane, it was apparent to
16 Ms. Heard that you were under the influence of both drugs and
17 alcohol?
18 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Well, I think the question has got to be were
19 you under the influence of, first of all, alcohol, and then
20 drugs, before you got on the plane.
21 MS. WASS: My Lord, I have asked that, and Mr. Depp does not
22 remember. 1 will certainly ask it again.
23 (To the witness) Were you under the influence of drugs
24 and/or alcohol before you got on the plane?
25 A. Ido not recall that I had been drinking. Ido not recall

2 that T had been taking cocaine, if that is the drug you are
3 referring to. 1 was addicted to the Roxicodone and I was
a going to kick those. So, if there was any, if I upset
5 Ms. Heard or, I do not deny that Ms. Heard probably saw that
6 with her eyes.
7 Q. What, saw that you were the worse for wear?
8 A. Ihave no doubt that she believed that.
9 Q Allright
10 A. And may have seen that with her eyes; but I believe that they
1 were not telling her the truth.
12 Q. Believing that, did you consider that she was being judgmental
13 towards you, judging you because she believed that you were
14 inebriated and under the influence of drugs?
15 A. Ithink that she - judgmental is a very good word to use,
16 yes, she was quite judgmental for many years over this issue,
17 yes.
18 Q. And on this occasion, you were spoiling for a fight,
19 I suggest?
20 A. Ido not know why you would say that. Ido not recall
21 spoiling for a fight, trying to start a fight?
22 Q. Yes, spoiling for a fight.
23 A. No, Twas not trying to spoil for a fight,
24 Q. You brought up the subject of her co-star, James Franco; do
25 You remember that?
[Page 298]

--- Page 130 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 A. Ido not remember that.
3 Q Youdonot remember that, Because James Franco was a subject
a that you felt quite strongly about, did you not, you have
5 explained that to us already?
6 A. Iwas, Isuspected that Ms. Heard was having an affair with
7 Mr. Franco.
8 Q Right
9 A Andit has since been confirmed that she was
10 Q. She was not having an affair with Mr. Franco at this time, was
11 she?
12 A. Ibelieve that she was.
13 Q. You believed that she was —
14 A. Ihave been told that she was.
15 Q. You have been told she was. Is that why you got so angry?
16 A. I—-we have not gotten to the anger yet. Ido not —
17 Q. You were screaming obscenities about James Franco to her on
18 the plane?
19 A. Screaming obscenities about James Franco on the plane?
20 Q. Yes.
21 A. With my two assistants or people who work with, and my chief
22 of security and two pilots and a stewardess?
23 Q Yes.
24 A. And lam screaming at Ms. Heard with -—

2 A Twould not do that
3 Q. This was not the first time you had behaved atrociously on an
1 airplane.
5 A. Idisagree with everything you are saying.
6 Q When say obscenities, you were talking about her getting
7 fucked with James Franco and you were talking about how she
8 liked getting fucked on the set, and you were making vulgar
9 references to her genitals?
10 A. Thats quite a stretch of her imagination.
11 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Depp, all that you need to do is to say
12 whether you agree or disagree with the proposition that is
13 being put to you.
14 THE WITNESS: And use the word, "I disagree? Or —
15 Q Idonot want to limit how you give your evidence, but if you
16 disagree, then by all means say so.
17 A. Yes.
18 Q So.Itake it that you disagree with what has just been put to
19 you?
20 A. Yes. Ivery much disagree with everything.
21 MS.WASS: I suggest that the more offensive you became, the less
22 that Ms. Heard would engage with you?
23 A. Again, I disagree.
24 Q Your staff simply allowed you to conduct yourself like this.
25 They did not judge you. They did not admonish you. They did
[Page 300]

--- Page 132 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 nothing to protect Ms. Heard from this tirade of abuse.
3 A. They had no reason to protect Ms. Heard.
4 Q. Tsuggest Ms. Heard moved seats on more than one occasion to
5 get away from you, and you started by throwing ice cubes at
6 her. At one stage, when she tried to move away from you, you
7 kicked one of the chairs so hard that it swivelled round and
8 hit her?
9 A 1
10 Q. You disagree?
11 A. Thave never seen anyone be able to push an airplane chair
12 that could assault someone. Aeroplane chairs are very —
13 well, we all know what they are like.
14 Q. You were ina blind rage, demanding to know how much she liked
15 ‘getting off with James Franco, and she refused to answer. And
16 you were so angry that she would not engage with you during
17 this discussion, you slapped her across the face in front of
18 everybody?
19 A. No, ma'am.
20 Q. And you called her "a go-getter slut” and "a whore"?
21 A. No, ma'am, I would not, no. Not under those circumstances
22 would I get that —
23 Q. And-- carry on, finish,
24 A. Iwould not get that, I would not —- there are possibilities
25 that if Ms. Heard and I had a fight where that sort of thing

2 could come out of my mouth, depending on what came out of her
3 mouth prior to. But I did not go into a rage and start
4 screaming at her in front of all these people.
5 Q. During the course of the flight you were demanding more
3 alcohol and oxygen from the flight attendant?
7 A. The oxygen tank, I remember the pilot, a lot of these crews.
8 Ihave flown with before, so I did ask for an oxygen tank,
9 justas a lark.
10 Q. Asa lark?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Whatis so funny about an oxygen tank?
13 A. When you put the oxygen mask on, and you turn the nozzle, you
14 are hit with pure oxygen. That is really it. So, it was kind
15 of, itis not oxygen, itis not a — I was not abusing a drug,
16 Iwas breathing oxygen and showing them, because I knew the
17 crew we had flown with them a lot, and the pilot, and I had
18 done that once before.
19 Q. Ms. Heard got up again from her seat in order to move away
20 from you, and you said to her, extremely aggressively: "Are
21 ‘you walking away from me?" And at that stage you kicked her
22 in the back as she was trying to get away from you.
23 A. Not true.
24 Q. And you were raging like a monster.
25 A. Nottrue.
[Page 302]

2 Q. And you eventually went to the toilet, the bathroom, if you
3 prefer, of the plane, and you passed out?
4 A. After Ms. Heard, or as Ms. Heard was berating me, screaming at
5 me, and whatnot, as is her wont, she began to get physical,
6 1did get up and then go to the bathroom. 1 grabbed a pillow
7 from the couch and I slept on the bathroom floor. 1 have done
8 that on more than a couple of occasions.
9 Q. You certainly slept on bathroom, toilet floors before. Has
10 ‘your assistant, Nathan Holmes, had to break into locked doors
11 to wake you up afier you have passed out on the toilet?
12 A. Ihave never passed out on the toilet. I have fallen asleep,
13 not in the middle of, let's say, relieving oneself, but cither
14 sitting on the toilet and leaning against the wall to sleep or
15 sleeping on the floor.
16 Q. Canyougoto file 7, tab3, please. I ought to have made it
17 plain that this flight from Boston to LA was on 24th May 2014;
18 all right?
19 MR JUSTICE NICOL: Justa minute. (Pause) Yes.
20 MS. WASS: Have you got file 7, tab 37
21 A File7,tab3. Sorry. (Pause) Yes, I have it.
22 Q. This was a text sent between Ms. Heard and her assistant, Kate
23 James, the one whom she asked not to send the film schedules
24 for the film schedules to. "I have to leave JD. He has just
25 freaked out on me. He is drinking again. It is bad, worse

2 than ever. Tneed out. Ttold Stephen, who is with him on
3 this trip, to help you with tickets for me and Savannah out of
4 here. Can you please book us on the Red Eye tomorrow morning,
5 please? Stephen will help arrange." Then later she sends a
[3 text saying, "And can you also see if you can redirect all of
7 these texts to me to Whitney's phone or just block him
8 entirely. Ineed to make this move. Best to have his
9 calls/texts sent to her so she can keep them to me."
10 A. "Keep them for me".
11 Q "Keep them for me".
12 A "Until a later time".
13 Q "Until a later time, please.” Was there anything you did that
14 could have caused Ms. Heard to say, "I need out"? Anything on
15 that plane journey that would make her think she wants out?
16 A. Well, we certainly had an argument and that commenced to be
17 physical, and I am sure she was, she sounds upset
18 Q. Your account of what happened on the plane is very different
19 from the account I have just put to you, and your account is
20 as follows, and this is from paragraph 36 of your witness
21 statement: "I remember the flight from Boston to Los Angeles
22 in detail. Thad drunk alcohol prior to and on the flight,
23 but my behaviour was not as alleged at all. Iwas drawing art
24 sketches in my notebook, as I like to do when travelling, when
25 Ms. Heard began to harangue me. Throughout the course of our
[Page 304]

--- Page 136 ---
1 DEPP - WASS

2 relationship, Ms. Heard would often look to argue with me,

3 berate me, or abuse me verbally and physically. By the time

4 at which the flight took place, I had worked out that the best

5 way to deal with this was simply not to engage and try to

6 retreat from the situation.” Then you said, "I took a pillow

7 to the bathroom, locked the door and slept on the floor to

8 avoid confrontation"; right?

9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Thatis the account that you stick to, is it?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Do you agree, Mr. Depp, that where there are accounts that are
13 directly contradictory, as there are in this case, Ms. Heard
12 saying that you were the monster, who slapped her, kicked her,
15 and was completely under the influence of drink and drugs, and
16 your account that you may have had a sip of something before
17 and on the plane, but you were quietly sketching in an art
18 book and did not want any confrontation at all, they are
19 totally different accounts, are they not?
20 A. My account and Ms. Heard's account?
21 Q. Yes?
22 A. Yes, ma'am. I think you will find the same throughout the
23 entire case.
24 Q. Yes, and do you agree that where there are two such different
25 accounts, so at odds with each other, it is helpful to look

2 for independent evidence?
3 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Ms. Wass, I am not sure that is really a
4 question for Mr. Depp to answer. It is open to you and to
5 Mr. Sherborne to make submissions that that is what I should
6 do,
7 MS. WASS: Allright. Can Task ita different way, and before
8 Mr. Depp answers, | want to seek my Lord's approval. Do you
9 agree that records of what was said in texts at the time these
10 incidents took place can be helpful as to -—
11 MR SHERBORNE: My Lord, this is exactly the same thing. What
12 Ms. Wass is plainly doing — and she did it with the e-mail
13 and I waited a very long time to hear the question is
14 reading documents that are not actually written to Mr. Depp,
15 and using him as a vehicle to comment on them. We all know
16 the practice, and i is a typical jury practice, and because
17 ‘your Lordship is a judge and only listens to the answer,
18 Ihave not got up every time. Where we reach the point that
19 Ms. Wass is trying to get Mr. Depp to accept submissions that
20 she is going to make in her closing speech, then we have
21 reached a time when, in my submission, this needs to stop,
22 particularly given the time and how long Ms. Wass has taken
23 and how long she still has to go.
24 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Sherborne, I agree with you to this
25 extent, as I have already indicated, that there is a division
[Page 306]

--- Page 138 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 between submissions which will come at the close of the
3 evidence and the evidence itself. 1f Ms. Wass wants to put to
4 Mr. Depp documents which she says, or will submit, are in
5 conflict with the statement that he has given, and wishes to
3 comment on those, then it seems to me that she is entitled to
7 do that.
8 MR. SHERBORNE: Yes, and she has done that throughout the
9 cross-examination, obviously, but these are a different class
10 of document, because as was revealed by what she said in her
11 last comment, which did not have a question in it, this is
12 simply being used, as I say, as a vehicle to get Mr. Depp to
13 say, "Yes, | agree that when one sees contemporaneous fexis,
14 they are helpful", or he will say they are not, and somehow
15 that will be used as his evidence. How can it possibly be his
16 evidence? Itis pure speculation
17 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I hear what you say, Mr. Sherborne. 1 have
18 already said that I agree with you to the extent of there.
19 being a division between what is appropriate in submissions
20 and what is appropriate in the course of evidence. Tam not
21 sure that I go entirely with you that everything or indeed a
22 substantial part of what Ms. Wass is putting is on the wrong
23 side.

7 ideal scenario, that we listen 10 it, the transcripts have
8 been agreed to have been put in the bundles so they ought to
9 have been there, and we can come back to this if necessary.
10 MR.SHERBORNE: Maybe there is a better answer. Iam trying to be
1 pragmatic. 1s this a good opportunity to take a five-minute
12 break? That allows Ms. Wass to find this and we can proceed
13 with this in what I might call a more sensible way. It is
14 just a suggestion.
15 MS. WASS: Iam very concerned about time. If we play this, we
16 can move on.
17 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Sherborne, I am also a litle concerned
18 about the time. Tt was a practical suggestion, but actually,
19 think it is best to move on.

3 A lam notsaying it is Ms. Heard's voice. Iam saying that it
4 sounds to me like it could be pretty much anyone's voice.
5 Ihave never heard that recording before. If it was submitted
6 into evidence, I have never heard that recording before.
7 Ihave never heard of the recording before. I would say that
8 it sounds almost like some animal in pain
9 Q. Yes. it does, but I am going to suggest that you are that
10 animal and if you were in pain, it was because of the
1 over-consumption of drugs and alcohol that happened on that
12 flight?
13 A. Ihave to say that I cannot say that that is me. I cannot
14 identify that sound as me. Therefore, I am sorry I have to
15 disagree with you.
16 Q. Going back to Mr. Deuters' texts on 28th, if that were you
17 —
18 A. Ifthat were me?
19 Q. Ifthat were you, it might offer an explanation as to why he
20 is telling Ms. Heard that he would keep in contact with her as
21 to how you are: "We will let you know when he is en route and
22 how he is in the car. He is in some pain, as you might
23 guess."
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. It helps understand those texts: do you agree or not agree?

2 A. Idonot know that the two are connected at al,
3 Q Rally?
4 A. No, Ido not know the origin of the tape. Ido not know when
5 the tape was made. Is there —
6 Q Well, there has been —
7 A. —— metadata on that tape?
8 Q. There has been evidence and there has been metadata, but it
9 was on 24th May —
10 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Now, I think, Ms. Wass, this is starting to
11 get into the realm of submissions.
12 MS. WASS: Iwill not start asking about metadata and the like.
13 Mr. Deuters told Ms. Heard you had been sick and he was going
14 to get you straight to bed. Were you sick when you arrived
15 back in LA or were you sick on the plane?
16 A. Clearly if Mr. Deuters is sending these texts to Ms. Heard,
17 I must been quite ill, yes.
18 Q. You must have been quite ill, and yet you said in your witness
19 statement, "I remember the flight from Boston to LA in
20 detail".
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Itseems that you have not remembered being sick at all. It
23 must be something you did not remember about that flight. Do
24 you agree?
25 A. There is nothing that says to me I was sick on the plane. He
[Page 314]

--- Page 146 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 is texting her from, I do not know where. It seems we were at
3 my house in Sweetzer so I cannot say that he is referring to
4 the mating call that I heard on the recording.
5 Q. Yousee, your account is that really it was Ms. Heard who
3 disgraced herself on the plane by being unpleasant,
7 judgmental, argumentative and really you were the peaceful
8 party and just went to the bathroom to get away from the
9 problems. That is your account, is it not?
10 A. Thatis my account. There is only so much — sorry.
11 Q. Thatis your account. Could you look at page 29 in the texts,
12 please, the third text down. You sent a text to Ms. Heard
13 some hours later.
14 A. Idonot have the text
15 Q. Youdo not have the text?
16 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: This is volume 6, is it?
17 MS. WASS: Yes, 6.
18 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Tab 119. I think, Ms. Wass, you said page 29,
19 did you?
20 MS. WASS: Yes. (Pause) Have you got page 297
21 A. Ido, indeed, yes.
22 Q. Ihave read out the two texts from Mr. Deuters to Ms. Heard.
23 and under that, there is one from you to Ms. Heard.
24 A Yes.
25 Q. Do yousee that?

2 A Where are we talking, I am sorry?
3 Q The third text down?
4 A Yes
5 Q. lItseems to have been sent about three hours after the last
6 text that Mr. Deuters sent Ms. Heard, do you agree?
7 Mr. Deuters's last text was at 7.38 and this one was at 10.42?
8 A. Yes Iscethat
9 Q. This is what you say to Ms. Heard: "Once again, I find myself
10 ina place of shame and regret. Of course I am sorry,
11 really don't know why or what happened, but I will never do
12 it again. 1 want to get better for you and for me. I must.
13 My illness somehow crept up and grabbed me. 1 cannot do it
14 again. 1 cannot live like that again and I know you can't
15 either. must get better and I will for both of us."
16 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: "For us both".
17 MS. WASS: "For us both starting today. 1love you. Again, Iam
18 sorry, so sorry. Tlove you and feel" -- there must be an "F"
19 missing there -- "so bad for letting you down. Yours.”
20 A. Yes, Isee that
21 Q. Now,if it was Ms. Heard who was the badly behaved party on
22 that aeroplane, why are you apologising to her?
23 A. The very simple answer to that could be one of a couple of
24 things. Iwas apologising possibly after she was unresponsive
25 to me trying to make things better on the plane because she
[Page 316]

--- Page 148 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 was upset. Unfortunately, there was, in some way with
3 Ms. Heard, because she would not let go of her beliefs, I had
1 to condition, you have to condition yourself to use words that
5 she finds pleasing as opposed to something that will set her
6 off, so there is a great deal of placation that was always
7 going on, a great deal of it. But also it could be that I
8 could be apologising for something that I said to her if
9 things did get heated and we exchanged foul words. 1 could be
10 apologising for that or it could be straight-up placation, as
11 was the case in a lot of instances, and | am sure she feels
12 the same. She has probably had to placate me or hide —
13 Q. Whydid you say you were in a place of shame and regret?
14 A. Sometimes one has to say that because it will take the poison
15 out of her quill.
16 Q. But you had done nothing, if you arc telling the truth, to
17 cause you shame or regret?
18 A. Ido not know that to be true. I may have done something to
19 cause shame and regret, which is to say that I might have said
20 something ugly to her. Tmight have verbally insulted her or
21 made some comment, but when words are being hurled at you, you
22 hurl them back, and there are many times that one feels great
23 regret for having done that
24 Q. You see, your account was that your behaviour was that you
25 were sketching in your notebook?

2 A Yes
3 Q. She was arguing with you?
4 A Yes
SQ. Youworked out the best way to deal with it was simply not to
3 engage, but to retreat from the situation, and you slept on
7 the bathroom floor in order to retreat from the situation.
8 ‘There is no mention there of any arguing by you. If that
9 account is correct, you had done absolutely nothing to feel
10 ashamed or regretful about, and yet here you are saying "Once
11 again’, so not just for the first time, "Once again, I find
12 myselfin a place of shame and regret"?
13 A. Yes, ma'am.
14 Q. Then you say, "I really do not know why or what happened"?
15 A. Yes, ma'am.
16 Q. The truth of itis, Mr. Depp, that you have no recollection
17 about your monstrous behaviour on that flight?
18 A. No, Ihave a very good recollection of my behaviour. Talso
19 know that once the plane touches down or when the plane is
20 ‘going into landing mode, I would have had to leave the
21 bathroom where I was sleeping on the floor and come back to my
22 seat. If the argument continued, if she was still upset, as
23 I can guarantee you she was, then we may have exchanged some
24 rather nasty verbal words, nasty words to one another.
25 Q. And whatillness are you talking about: "My illness somehow
[Page 318]

--- Page 150 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 crept up and grabbed me"?
3 A That, to me, sounds like I went straight to excessive drinking
4 after the initial altercation began.
SQ Excessive drinking on the plane?
6 A. Before I went to the bathroom or in the bathroom or after the
7 bathroom.
8 Q. So. now we should take on board that you are accepting that
9 you may have engaged in excessive drinking; is that the
10 position now?
11 A. Tam being completely honest with you. Tam thinking that if
12 Tam saying that and I am apologising for something, I believe
13 that it is very probable and sounds like something that I may
14 have done, post -—
15 Q. Youmay have got very drunk on the plane?
16 A. postargument. As Iwas upset, she was upset. But
17 certainly not enough time to get, as you say, black-out drunk
18 or anything of that nature. Yes, I did drink when Ms. Heard
19 would get upset.
20 Q. Tam talking about this specific journey?
21 A. Yes, and Iam trying to explain it
22 Q. Youare saying you did drink on this specific journey
23 excessively?
24 A. Excessively is maybe, maybe overstating.

2 asking you what the illness was that you are referring to.

3 THE WITNESS: Yes, what Iam tying to say is that the illness that

4 crept up and grabbed me is probably that I went to the bottle,

5 that "I am sorry that I went to the bottle. Tam sorry that

6 you fel this way. 1am sorry for everything that happened

7 Tam sorry for everything I did, or anything I did." 1am

8 sorry to say, this was quite a regular occurrence between us.

9 MS. WASS: It was a regular occurrence for you to get excessively
10 drunk and/or drugged up and completely forget what you had
11 done; that was what was a regular occurrence?

12 A. No,maam. disagree.

13 Q. Letus carry with the texts, please. Halfway down that page,

14 still on page 29, Christie, your sister, says: "Do you want

15 to talk?" She sends that to Ms. Heard; do you sce that?

16 A. Idoindeed.

17 Q. Then Ms. Heard says: "I can't. 1am sorry, but thanks for

18 offering, love you." Your sister says: "Could be things get

19 better from all of this. I don't know but may try to be

20 helpful and encouraging and supportive. I would love it if we

21 could talk even a little, I want to help you both."

22 Ms. Heard said: "Yes, and I do hope he gets better this time.

23 But I can't keep staying and supporting him just to watch him

24 doit all over again. He has done this many times before.

25 Tokyo, the island, London, remember that, many, many times,

--- Page 152 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 and L always stay. Always believe he is going to get better,
3 and every three or so months I am in exactly the same
4 position.” All right? Now, are you able to say, and it may
5 be that you are not, when Ms. Heard is talking about you
6 getting better, is she talking about what you regard as your
7 illness? Is it the same thing you are talking about, the
8 excessive drinking?
9 A. Ibelieve what she is referring to is my, or our approach to
10 one another, that I, my approach towards her is more agreeable
11 to her.
12 Q. Mr. Deuters sent another text to Ms. Heard, the next text
13 down: "Hey, he's up. He's much better, clearer. He doesn't
12 remember much, but we took him through all that happened. He
15 is sorry, very sorry and just wants to get better, which
16 allows us to make him follow-up on that promise." Did
17 Mr. Deuters take you through what had happened on the flight?
18 A. Mr. Deuters and I had a conversation. Ms. Heard was still
19 very upset and I think very — she was very stubborn about
20 hearing anything that did not ring true with her side of
21 things. And on many occasions, I am somewhat embarrassed to
22 say, that I had to tell Mr. Deuters, and I recall telling
23 Mr. Deuters, just agree with whatever she said, just placate
24 her. T can't take it any more, no more fights, no more
25 violence, no more freak-outs, just placate her. That was our

2 practice.
3 Q. That was the plan that you cooked up with Mr. Deuters, was it,
4 when he told you what had happened?
5 A. Yes. We cooked up a plan to placate Ms. Heard, but in fact
3 that was not cooked up then, it was cooked up a lot longer,
7 prior.
8 Q Before the plane incident at all?
9 A. The placation of Ms. Heard, yes, it started —
10 Q. I understand.
11 A. — quite ,a year or two, or maybe more before that
12 Q. Before this incident?
13 A Absolutely, yes.
14 Q. Mr. Deuters indicated that you did not remember much.
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Did you tell Mr. Deuters that you did not remember much about
17 the journey?
18 A. Idonot recall telling Mr. Deuters that I did not remember
19 anything about the journey. I remember having a conversation
20 with Mr. Deuters saying, "Please, just tell her whatever she
21 wants to hear, placate her”
22 Q. Tunderstand that. But that conversation was two years
23 beforehand, you tell us?
24 A Nonono. That placation started years before. It became a
25 necessary tool to be able to deal with Ms. Heard without her
[Page 322]

--- Page 154 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 going into a rather high energy screaming match.
3 Q. Iwonder if you can help us as to why Mr. Deuters might have
4 said: "He doesnt remember much but we took him through all
5 that happened. He's sorry, very sorry and he wants to get
6 better, which allows us to make him follow-up on that
7 promise.” You had already said you were really sorry,
8 Mr. Depp?
9 A Yes
10 Q. But can you think of a reason why Mr. Deuters would say, would
11 it placate Ms. Heard to say you did not remember much about
12 what had happened? Why would that placate Ms. Heard?
13 A. Because for her, that it looks like she was correct, and
14 Ms. Heard likes to be correct.
15 Q. Then, Mr. Deuters says: "He's teary. He doesnt want to be a
16 fuck up any more, his words. . (reads to the words)... spoken
17 to C" that is Christie "we're going to set him up with
18 Dr. Kipper on Wednesday, hopefully. He won't be skipping this
19 time."
20 A. "Won't be skipping at this time", yes.
21 Q. Yes. Did you miss an appointment with —
22 A Apparently did, yes

2 Charlie", is "Charlie" Charlie Dunit?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. "Tm not worried about bringing Charlie up, Tl do that when
5 he's awake." Then, Ms. Heard texts Mr. Deuters, saying
[3 “I've not heard from him, which I expected. 1 still want to
7 fly back to NYC today on the Red-Eye, though. can't keep
8 doing this." Then Mr. Deuters said: "His phone is fucking up
9 I'm restarting it. (reads to the words)... and he wasn't
10 talking physically." This was just placating Ms. Heard, was
11 it?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q "think he's just texted you. He's incredibly apologetic and
14 knows he has done wrong (reads to the words)... ell like
15 we're in a critical juncture.” Again, all said just to calm
16 Ms. Heard down; is that right?
17 A. Lam trying to see where you are.
18 Q. Sorry, where are you, Mr. Depp?
19 A. Looking for what you are reading, sorry.
20 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: If you look on page 30 of the text schedule.
21 THE WITNESS: Sorry, "feel we are at a critical juncture", I see
22 that now.
23 MS.WASS: Then she said to him: "I don't know how to be around
24 him after what he did to me yesterday." Have you any idea
25 what she might have been referring to?

2 A. Tam going to say she is talking about the experience on the
3 aeroplane.
4 Q. Mr. Deuters was on the aeroplane, so he would have known what
5 she was talking about, presumably?
6 A. Yes, she voiced it pretty well, yes.
7 Q. Then she said: "I don't know if I can stay with him, I need
8 time." Mr. Deuters said: "He wants to see you so much, he's
9 distraught." Then, she said: "Don't worry about the flights,
10 I'm taking the car. Thank you.” Then she said: "He thinks
11 he doesn't deserve this. Obviously he has no idea what he did
12 or to the extent that he did it." Is there any reason you can
13 think of why Ms. Heard would be of the opinion that you had no
14 idea what you did?
15 A. Ibelieve that Ms. Heard was very happy with the idea that she
16 was correct about my black-out or violence or screaming or
17 whatever she, her allegations are.
18 Q. "If someone was truly honest with him about how bad it really
19 was, he would be appalled. The man Johnny is would be
20 humiliated and definitely wouldn't say to me that he doesn't
21 deserve it. I'm sad he does not have a better way to really
22 know the severity of his actions yesterday. Unfortunately for
23 me, | remember them in full, in full detail, everything that
24 happened." Mr. Deuters said this: "He was appalled, when
25 1 told him he kicked you, he cried."

2 A Yes.
3 Q Why was it going to appease Ms. Heard for Mr. Deuters to say
4 that you cried when you were told that you kicked her?
5 A Again and | am embarrassed to say it, I told Mr. Deuters, my
6 instructions to him were placate her, tell her anything she
7 wants to hear, tell her that I am sad, you know, because she
8 will calm down if she has heard that she is right. So, to get
9 past this very fractured argument, yet another argument,
10 Mr. Deuters did exactly what I asked him to do,
11 Q Youspecifically said: "Tell her I don't remember anything,
12 but tell her that you told me that I kicked her and that
13 Ieried." Were those your instructions to Mr. Deuters?
14 A. didnot go into specific instructions. 1did not write any
15 dialogue for him. Tleft it to Mr. Deuters to follow my
16 instructions, and I trusted that he would get the point to her
17 that I was feeling bad about having let her down and upset
18 her, or whatever she says I did, just agree with it, to get
19 through this, just to get through it. As she is saying,
20 "I can't take it, I am going to leave him, I can't take it any
21 more", well, she was feeling that for a very good reason,
22 because we argued all the time. Twas feeling exactly the
23 same.
24 Q. She was feeling it because you were assaulting her all the
25 time?
[Page 326]

2 A. lam going to respectfully disagree with what you just said.
3 Q. Kicking a woman in the back, that is not the action of a
a Southern gentleman, is it?
5 A. Thatis not - kicking a woman in the back is not the action
6 of any gentleman. Kicking a woman in the back is a horrid and
7 damming act
8 Q Youwould call someone who did that a wife-beater, would you
9 not?
10 A. If someone kicked a woman in the back, would I call him a
11 wife-beater?
12 Q. Yes.
13 A. No, Iwould call hima sick person. I would call them an
14 animal. 1 would call him a savage. 1 would call him a nasty,
15 Twould call them - itis one of the most disgusting things
16 that anyone has ever said about me, and accused me of. So,
17 1 deny that T kicked her in the back. Yes.
18 Q. Yousaid you would not call a man who kicked a woman in the
19 back a wife-beater, but do you agree -—
20 A. Imeanawife-beater, I would call him all kinds of things.

11 text, I will not respond, at least not in text and not right
12 away. She seems to have figured it all out. Happy reading."
13 This is the forwarded text. "There are so many things to say,

15 what | want to say to you. All I can say is I am heartbroken.
16 My whole world came crashing down on me, I feel so lost.

2 afraid of. Seeing such a beautiful thing as our love
3 slaughtered right in front of my eyes, and not being able to
14 do anything about it. That is what, who I am running from,
5 that demon. Because despite how much I have tried to fight
6 him off, you, he has been winning. 1am scared, Johnny, so
7 scared, | watch as this thing steals my life out from under
8 me. He steals my man from me and replaces him with something
9 terrifying and unrecognisable."
10 That was the text that Ms. Heard sent you, was it not?
11 A. Yes, it appears so.
12 Q Sheis describing the monster, is she not, that part of you
13 that takes over in drink?
14 A. Sheis describing, yes, the — what she called, referred to as
15 “the monster”, yes.
16 Q. Could you go over to page 34, please. Now, I understand your

9 Q "Ugly mate. No food for days. Powders, half a bottle of
10 whisky, a thousand Red Bull and vodas, pills, two bottles of
11 champers on the plane, what do you get .. (reads to the
12 words)... screaming obscenities and insulting any fuck who got
13 near.” What exactly are you talking about in that text,
14 Mr. Depp?
15 A. Ican see it says I drank all night before I picked up
16 Ms. Heard to fly to LA. I get that.
17 Q. "No food for days"?
18 A. "Ugly. mate. no food for days, powders —"
19 Q. What are powders?
20 A. Powders would have been cocaine.
21 Q Right. You suggested that I was including cocaine in
22 everything. Tt appears from what you are telling Mr. Bettany,
23 cocaine was involved?
24 A. Well, that is to say, if this entire text is about the plane
25 ride.

3 A Yes Idid But—
4 Q. Do you remember writing it?
5 A. lam going to stop, "l am going to stop properly the booze
6 thing, darling. Drank all night before I picked Amber up to
7 flyto LA this past Sunday. Ugly, mate. No food for days,
8 powders, half a bottle of whisky, thousand Red Bulls and
9 vodka, pis", all that. It does not necessarily mean that
10 Iwas talking about that plane ride. I could have been
11 talking about what I was going through at that moment.
12 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Depp, there is a section of the text that
13 says "two bottles of champers on plane”; is that about the
14 plane ride?
15 A. Well, on the plane, yes, itis.
16 Q. Two bottles of champagne?
17 A. Two bottles of champagne on plane, okay, yes, I guess that is
18 it.
19 Q. That was about the plane?
20 MS. WASS: So, you are talking, "I picked Amber to fly to LA this
21 past Sunday".
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Then: "Ugly, mate. No food for days ,..(reads to the
24 words)... ills", you think that might be about a completely
25 different incident; is that your evidence?

3 out, the two bottles of champagne on plane, what do you get?
4 So, Tam going to say that I made a mistake about the full
5 intake on the plane.
6 Q. You did consume more than you were previously admitting to; is
7 that right?
8 A. Yes, yes, butitis not -- I do not remember that it was one
9 of those flights like that.
10 Q. One of those flights?
11 A Thave had several, yes.
12 Q. You have had several flighted and you have had several flights
13 where you have behaved badly like this.
14 A. Thave had several flights where we have argued.
15 Q. Well, we are not talking about arguing, we are talking about
16 the amount of alcohol and the amount of cocaine that you had
17 before and on the flight?
18 A. Yes, this sounds like —
19 Q. It sounds like you overdid it, does it not?
20 A. Itsounds like I absolutely overdid it. it sounds like it was
21 avery self-destructive moment and I was incorrect in my
22 statement that I had taken, I had not taken cocaine and things
23 of that nature. 1am, I can only say my apologies to the
24 court in terms of that, but I did not remember that flight
25 being such a, the entire flight being such a nightmare.
[Page 332]

--- Page 164 ---
1 DEPP - WASS
2 Q. But you do not remember that flight, full stop, I suggest?
3 A. No, I do remember.
4 Q. Where in all of are you sketching your art?
5 A. Atthe beginning of the flight,
6 Q. How long did that last?
7 A. Until Ms. Heard started to express that she was displeased
8 with me.
9 Q. You see, you said four lines down, after the two bottles of
10 champagne and what do you get, "...an angry aggro Indian."
11 ‘What is that a reference to?
12 A. Sorry. Native American.
13 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Sorry, angry?
14 A. Aggro Indian,
15 Q. Is a reference to a native American?
16 A. Myself being an angry aggro native American, I have part of
17 native American blood.
18 MS. WASS: You are an aggro angry Indian, in your words, in a
19 fucking blackout.
20 A. Thatis what it says, yes.
21 Q. ltdoes. I have asked you more than once, whether you had
22 parts of this flight that you did not remember, and you have
23 repeatedly said you remembered it all clearly.

2 hit the bottle at some stage. I mean, you had a blackout, did
3 you not?
4 A. Icannot say that I had a full blackout, because I do have
5 memories of the flight.
6 Q. Some memories?
7 A. Some memories of the flight, yes.
8 Q. But parts of that flight are blacked out?
9 A. Apparently. But, yes, apparently that is what I am saying to
10 Mr. Bettany.
11 Q Yes. Is there any reason why you would say that to
12 Mr. Bettany if it were not true?
13 A. Probably not.
14 Q. No. You carry on with the blackout, after the words
15 "blackout", screaming obscenities?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. You remember I accused you of screaming obscenities to
18 Ms. Heard about her relationship, or what you were suggesting
19 was her relationship with James Franco; do you remember those
20 questions about an hour ago?
21 A. Ido indeed, yes.
22 Q. You denied that completely screaming obscenities of any sort?
23 A. Idid not recall screaming any obscenities, but I did say at a
24 certain point the argument escalated quite heavily into
25 screaming at one another. And I retreated to the bathroom,

2 with the pillow. Ido remember that.

3 Q. Having heard that recording on the plane, do you think now

4 that might have been you making those animal noises?

5 A Icertainly hope not. But Ido not I do not recognise that

6 as my voice. I would say that it is something that I have

7 heard once, just today, and -——

8 Q. Wecan play it again, if it helps. Would you like to hear it

9 again?
10 A. No, Tam fine. Thank you very much. If it is me, then I was
11 definitely dealing with a problem.
12 Q Yes. If you were blacking out, and you were dealing with a
13 problem, you may have done things that you have absolutely no
14 memory of?
15 A. Imay have done things that I have no memory of, but
16 Mr. Deuters was there, Mr. Judge was there who would never
17 have let anything happen to Amber, Ms. Heard. And I certainly
18 am not a violent person, especially with women, and I have
19 been violent in the past, as we have spoken, when provoked.
20 “This is clearly is, I made a mistake, and I pardon, I beg
21 your pardon, I spoke out of tun, and I spoke incorrectly
22 about a situation
23 Q. Canljust, for the avoidance of any doubt, try to establish

2 A Yes
3 Q. Do you accept that you took cocaine?
4 A. Ithink what we are talking about is, where it says, "powders,
5 10 food for days", we are talking days. So, itis not that
6 1, that I am saying I did cocaine on the plane.
7 Q. Halfa bottle of whisky?
8 A. "Half a bottle of whisky, a thousand Red Bulls and vodkas,
9 pills, two bottles of champers on the plain, and what do you
10 get." Yes.
11 Q. I'wantto make sure itis quite clear what you are saying
12 about the Boston plane incident. You were very drunk, you had
13 taken drugs either before or during, or both. Do you agree
14 with that?
15 A. Sure, for the purposes of getting through this, let's say,
16 yes, everything you have said I agree.
17 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Depp, I realise it is the end of the
18 afternoon, but do not feel that you must say things for the
19 sake of getting through this. What I want to hear is your
20 evidence and the evidence that is the truth. So, you tell me,
21 as best as you recall, whether or not you had been taking
22 cocaine either on the plane or before you got on the plane?
23 THE WITNESS: I honestly, your Lordship, I cannot recall whether
24 Twas doing cocaine, but from the condition that this text is
25 explaining to Mr. Bettany, it sounds like it would not be out
[Page 336]

--- Page 168 ---

2 of the question in any way. The cocaine would have,
3 I imagine, kept me awake for a lot longer. But I will say,
14 based on this text, that, yes, it is very likely that I was
5 doing pills, alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, and certainly as I
6 had not been detoxed from the Roxicodone, I was on Roxicodone
7 as well. So, yes, and again, I apologise for that.
8 MS. WASS: You accept that now?
9 A. Yes, sure, I accept that, ma'am.
10 Q We havea record of what you just said. and it will be on the
11 record. When I put to you earlier that you were under the
12 influence of drink and drugs when the car was waiting on the
13 runway, do you remember I suggested that to you, that you
14 arrived in the car and kept everyone waiting, you said this is
15 always how it happens. Do you think now, you were wrong when
16 you said you were waiting to do a detox with Dr. Kipper and
17 you did not want to overdo it, or words to that effect?
18 A. Tam sorry, I did not understand that.
19 Q. It may be —
20 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I think -—
21 MS. WASS: I can leave that.
22 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: - the end of the day is fast approaching

5 MS. WASS: Yes, "My darling Patty Lee, I miss you and worship you
6 and there is nothing wrong between us. Never ever could that
7 happen. 1 have just been so beyond busy with the film here in
8 Boston and then back to LA for kiddies. When I was in New
9 York, there were brief visits and fucked and charged by
10 horrific fights with Amber. 1 fucked up and drank and got
11 shitty. Was so disappointed in myself."
12 So, again you are telling somebody that you did not have
13 to placate that you had been, using your words, "shitty with
14 Amber?
15 A Yes. Isce that and I agree, yes.
16 Q. Have you seen any accusations that were made at the time, so I
17 am not asking about 2016 and beyond, that is to say afier your
18 divorce, suggesting it was Ms. Heard that had behaved badly on
19 the plane?
20 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Well, Ms. Wass, if itis the defendants’ case
21 that there is no text, then of course that is a matter that
22 you can include in your submissions.
23 MS. WASS: Allright.

3 Tam afraid, considerably longer than I had anticipated. Ido

B address the court about timetable, please?
6 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Yes, indeed. Can Mr. Depp stand down from the
7 witness box while you do so?
8 MS. WASS: Of course, itis my Lord's prerogative to allow him to
9 do that, but T would have no objection.
10 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Good. Then, Mr. Depp, you are going to
1 continue your evidence tomorrow.

17 that Ms. Wass wants to say to me about timing

[Page 339]
1 DISCUSSION
2 MR JUSTICE NICOL: Yes, Ms. Wass.
3 MS. WASS: My Lord, there were three days set aside for
4 cross-examination of the claimant in this case. Two matters
5 have really made that or caused that timetable to be called
6 into question. The first is that yesterday — it was only
7 yesterday — I have not got the exact time, but Mr. Sherborne
8 asked to ask some questions in chief. It took slightly longer
9 than he anticipated and I make no criticism of Mr. Sherborne
10 in that regard because Mr. Depp likes to give very full
1n answers, as some witnesses do, and again it is no criticism of
12 that witness. However, it has taken considerably longer in
13 the main because of the length and repetition of some of the
14 answers.
15 ‘The position is that -- and last night appreciated the
16 words that my Lord indicated at the close of the day yesterday
17 that really we were hoping to stick by the timetable
18 I revised and hoped to get through seven of the incidents
19 today. Ihave got through three. Not all of them are long,
20 as my Lord knows, but in some cases, such as the Boston plane
21 incident, there is a lot of evidence and Mr. Depp, as my Lord
22 appreciates, now he has seen it, has given an account which is
23 more consistent with the defence case than the claimant's
24 case.
25 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Now, Ms. Wass, we are towards the end of the
[Page 340]

--- Page 172 ---
1 DISCUSSION
2 day. Let us keep to what you want to say about timing.
3 MS. WASS: I have had an opportunity of speaking to those
1 instrueting me and my juniors about timing and T would ask
5 that Friday morning is allocated for Mr. Depp's evidence. The
6 good news, if T can put it this way, is that we have all
7 considered the length of cross-examination of the claimant's
8 witnesses.
9 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: The other witnesses.
10 MS. WASS: The other witnesses, sorry, yes. Has my Lord got a
11 copy of the up-to-date timetable?
12 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Just a moment. (Pause) Yes.
13 MS. WASS: My Lord will see that on Friday 10th, the witnesses are
14 Sean Bett, who is, I think, at court at the moment -- he is
15 one of Mr. Depp's guards — and Kevin Murphy. Mr. Bett will
16 not be a lengthy witness. Mr. Murphy will be lengthier than
17 some, but certainly not half a day. Tt may well be that if he
18 is put on a moming, either on Monday or Tuesday, Tuesday
19 preferably, or actually Wednesday or Thursday, any of those:
20 ‘mornings could accommodate a witness of the length of
21 Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Bett could easily be accommodated in one
22 of the other days. So, my application is that given the
23 difficulties that have arisen, consideration is given to
24 revising the timetable.
25 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Right.

2 MS.WASS: It will not increase the overall length of the trial,
3 which I know will be very much in the court's mind.
4 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: In addition to your cross-examination, | was
5 going to say Mr. Sherborne, but it may not be Mr. Sherborne,
6 but somebody on the claimant's behalf is going to need to have
7 an opportunity to re-examine.
8 MS. WASS: Yes
9 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: How does that fit with what you are
10 suggesting?
11 MS. WASS: Well, Ihave no idea. That really is a question best
12 dealt with by Mr. Sherborne, if I may say so, because only he
13 knows how long he is likely to be.
14 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: He has heard part of your cross-examination.
15 MS. WASS: Yes.
16 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Butare you saying that you think you will
17 need all of Friday moming or will there be some space for
18 re-examination on Friday morning?
19 MS. WASS: Realistically, I will need all of Friday moming,
20 particularly since the confidential aspect of this will be
21 dealt with all in one go. Although, it is chronological,
22 Ihave kept that apart,
23 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: That is what I asked to you do.
24 MS. WASS: Of course, and that is a very sensible way of dealing
25 with it, but it does mean that there is some catching up to

2 do. Realistically, I would require all of Friday morning.
3 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: So, any re-examination is going to be Friday
1 afternoon. (Pause) Mr. Sherborne.
5 MR. SHERBORNE: My Lord, yes. Your Lordship will have the revised
[3 draft timetable and you will see that we have had to work to a
7 very strict timetable. Tt was made clear at the pre-trial
8 review by your Lordship and it is one of the reasons why
9 your Lordship took the view that we should not have the usual
10 openings delivered orally, notwithstanding the fact that
11 ‘your Lordship will recall that I asked that we should do so.
12 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: You opposed that, I mean very understandably,
13 but you —
14 MR. SHERBORNE: Yes, I did. It is entirely a matter for
15 ‘your Lordship, but you took the view that we did not have
16 enough time because we had such a tight strict timetable.
17 ‘That is why the timetable has been agreed. What your Lordship
18 sees is that the first three days are taken up with
19 housekeeping ~ it was accepted that there would be some
20 housekeeping at the beginning of day 1 - and that we would
21 complete Mr. Depp's evidence by the end of Thursday, and that
22 would also include any re-examination
23 Now we are being told by Ms. Wass that the timetable has
24 slipped hugely because, first of all, I asked questions in
25 chief. Well, what I can say about that is that your Lordship.

2 will have noted that at most, I was 15 minutes, and in any
3 event, your Lordship has sat for an additional half an hour
a this momming, so any time taken up by my examination-in-chief
5 has been more than compensated for by the court and court
6 staff being asked to sit half an hour carly.
7 In my submission, if Ms. Wass has not progressed fast
8 enough then that is not the fault of Mr. Depp. Given that we
9 have a very large number of witnesses and a very tight
10 timetable, not least because of the video link evidence, and
11 certainly if one looks at Friday, we have a number of
12 witnesses who are giving evidence by video link, there is a
13 very good reason why we are being kept to a timetable. If we
14 do not keep to it, we are going to encounter far more problems
15 than one would encounter in what I might call a normal trial.
16 ‘Your Lordship, with respect, very reasonably pointed out at
17 the beginning of this trial why there were certain features of
18 this case which took it outside of the norm and that is one of
19 the principal features. It is going to prove, in my
20 submission, extremely problematic if we do not stick to it. 1
21 simply do not understand, with the greatest respect to
22 Ms. Wass, how she can possibly state, as she did, that we can
23 say that it is not going to affect the overall length of the
24 trial.
25 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I realise the cross-examination is not
[Page 344]

--- Page 176 ---
1 DISCUSSION
2 complete, but how long do you estimate your re-examination
3 will be on the basis of what you have heard so far?
1 MR. SHERBORNE: On the basis of what I have heard so far, which is
5 two days, about an hour or so, but that is only on the basis
6 of these two days. We do have another day and potentially, if
7 your Lordship accedes to a whole morning -- we really are in a
8 position where we simply do not have the luxury of that, as
9 ‘your Lordship says then that is going to increase. am
10 very concerned about the effect if we go, in any significant
11 way, into Friday.
12 Now, of course, it is one thing for Friday morning to be
13 re-examination, and that allows Ms. Wass all of tomorrow, but
14 if we go into Friday with cross-examination, we are bound, in
15 ‘my submission, to slip into Friday afternoon and that is going
16 to cause serious problems. So whilst, at the moment, the
17 timetable is agreed between us on the basis that
18 re-examination would be fitted into Thursday, I can see that
19 if your Lordship permits, then at least Ms. Wass can have
20 until the end of tomorrow.
21 In my submission, there has been no proper basis laid
22 for saying that there have been difficulties encountered.
23 ‘This is exactly the way in which this trial was always going
24 to proceed. Ido not think anyone can say there is anything
25 unforeseeable that has happened over the last two days other

2 than the fact that Ms. Wass has taken it very slowly. That is
3 obviously a matter for her, but she has been allowed up to
a three days to cross-examine. In my submission, in the context
5 of this tral, that is more than ample. We all had waning of
[i what your Lordship said right from the start about this being
7 a strict timetable.
8 MR. JUSTICENICOL: Yes. Ms. Wass, is there anything you want to
9 say?
10 MS. WASS: I know my Lord will weigh up the justice to both
1 parties, and if the claimant is not going to be tested on
12 possibly the most important parts, chronologically those at
13 the very end, that will put the defence in the hugest
14 disadvantage and, in my submission, potentially compromise the
15 faimess of this trial.
16 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Ms. Wass and Mr. Sherborne, I do appreciate
17 that Mr. Depp's evidence is one of the two particularly
18 important witnesses in the case, and 1 am conscious that when
19 Tam told by leading counsel for the defendants that she
20 thinks that faimess to her clients requires her to have
21 rather more time on that particular witness, then I think
22 1 should accede to it to some extent, What I am going to say
23 is that Mr. Depp's evidence, including his re-examination,
24 must conclude by Friday lunchtime.
25 Now, I will, overnight, allow you and Mr. Sherborne to

2 fairly divide the time allocated for re-examination. He is
3 entitled to re-examine and he is entitled to make some
4 intelligent guess at how much is going to be needed for the
5 part of the cross-examination that he has not yet heard. But
6 Tam affraid that if you and he cannot agree on what is a fair
7 division of Friday morning, then I will have to make a ruling.
§ MS. WASS: May I make one observation? I understand that the two
9 witnesses who are giving evidence by video link on Friday
10 afternoon, Officers Haddon and Saenz, that link is due to be
11 active at three o'clock. Now, could I ask my Lord to consider
12 the possibility of starting their evidence at three o'clock,
13 which would give slightly longer on Friday for Mr. Depp's
14 cross-examination and re-examination, because, as I understand
15 it, itis their evidence that is the difficult evidence to be
16 arranged.
17 MR. SHERBORNE: We have got Travis McGivern, as I understand it,
18 also on Friday afternoon.
19 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Mr. Sherborne, I am going to cut across you
20 because I had understood and expressed my understanding of the
21 difficulties that Ms. Wass has faced and, to some extent,
22 Ihave made allowance for those. However, I am afraid I
23 cannot go as far as you have requested so that effectively
24 Mr. Depp's evidence would continue through into Friday
25 afternoon. Tam afraid the trial timetable simply does not

3 going to try to carve up Friday morning. Hopefully, we can
7 come to an agreement
8 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I would hope that you are able to do that,
9 es.
10 MR. SHERBORNE: I hope we can, but just so that your Lordship will
1n understand, at the moment, as say, it i at least an hour,
12 and that is on the basis of two days. There is another day at
13 least. Your Lordship knows that there is only a finite amount
14 of time between the court starting and lunchtime and that is
15 about two and a half hous.
16 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I have said that I will sit at 10 clock each
17 day, so you have three hours before lunch.
18 MR SHERBORNE: Your Lordship can do the maths and there is no
19 doubt that Ms. Wass can, but on any view, I will be asking for
20 the majority of that time for re-examination.
21 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Iwill leave you to have those discussions.
22 Assay, if necessary, I can adjudicate, but I would hope
23 that, on that sort of mater, it is not necessary.
24 MR. SHERBORNE: Thope so too, my Lord
25 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Allright. So, 10 o'clock tomorrow.

1 DISCUSSION
2 MS. WASS: My Lord, sorry, would my Lord forgive me? (Pause)
3 There has been a suggestion -- and I apologise in advance if I
4 am relaying this message incorrectly — that my Lord's bundles
5 could benefit from some reorganisation. As I understand it,
6 there is a possibility that that could be done this evening.
7 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Ms. Wass, if there is going to be any
8 reorganisation of my bundles, that should be done by my clerk.
9 Twill ask my clerk to come down into court and you can
10 discuss what needs to be done.
11 MS. WASS: Very well. Thank you.
12 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Does that conclude everything?
13 MR. WOLANSKI: My Lord, you got a note from me last night on the
14 discrete issue, which is the matter of Ms. de Cadanet's
15 cross-examination application. You received a short note and
16 a short exhibit.
17 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: I did.
18 MR. WOLANSKI: Ido not know how your Lordship wishes to deal with
19 that. Perhaps it would be for the claimant's team to have an
20 opportunity to put it in writing and then for your Lordship to
21 determine the matter, perhaps in writing, so that we do not
22 —
23 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: If it helps, Mr. Wolanski -- and of course
24 I have not heard anybody making submissions on this so what I
25 am about to express is a provisional view initially, I was

1 DISCUSSION
2 not terribly impressed with what Ms. de Cadanet had to say in
3 terms of its usefulness for the evidence in this trial.
4 MR. WOLANSKI: It does not come as entirely a surprise to hear
5 that your Lordship has taken that view, but in the light of
6 that, again, it might be that the matter can be very readily
7 resolved, but we would appreciate -—
8 MR. JUSTICE NICOL: Well, can I just say that even without any
9 cross-examination of Ms. de Cadanet, I struggle to see how

10 that piece of evidence was going to take the matter a great

11 deal further. Can I leave it to you and Mr. Sherborne, if it

12 is Mr. Sherbome who is going to have responsibility for this,

13 to discuss that further. If it does need a ruling from me,

12 Twill make one at a convenient time.

15 MR. WOLANSKI: Yes.

16 MR.JUSTICE NICOL: Thank you. Is there anything else? (No

17 response) Good.
